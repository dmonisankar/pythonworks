{"RuleSource": "Lithium Battery Shipping Guidelines - 4th Edition", "RuleContext": "5.6 Packing Instructions\nThe IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations contain 6 packing instructions for lithium batteries. These Guidelines have further broken those into 14 different instructions for each section to facilitate shipping of each section. To facilitate discussions with users of the DGR, Table 5.6.A shows the source packing instruction numbers and applicable sections for each.\nPlease refer to Table 5.6.A Packing Instruction Mapping.", "RuleName": "Packing_Instruction_966-II", "RuleAttributes": {"sp_handling_instr": "XXX", "additional_attr": "xxx"}, "Rule": "Packing Instruction 966\u2013II\nPlease refer to section 2.3.4 for operator variations.\nIntroduction\nThis instruction applies where the equipment is packed with lithium ion cells with a Watt-hour rating not exceeding 20 Wh or lithium ion batteries with a Watt-hour rating not exceeding 100 Wh.\nFor the purposes of this packing instruction \u201cequipment\u201d means the device or apparatus for which the lithium cells or batteries will provide electrical power for its operation.\nA single cell battery as defined in Part III, sub-section 38.3.2.3 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria is considered a \u201ccell\u201d and must be transported according to the requirements for \u201ccells\u201d for the purpose of this packing instruction.\nLithium ion cells and batteries meeting the requirements in this section are not subject to other additional requirements of these Guidelines except for:\n(a) dangerous goods in passenger and crew baggage (Subsection 2.2). Only those lithium ion batteries as specifically permitted may be carried in carry-on baggage;\n(b) dangerous goods in air mail (Subsection 2.1.5);\n(c) the marking and labelling requirements of 7.5;\n(d) the documentation requirements of 8.4;\n(e) reporting of dangerous goods accidents, incidents and other occurrences (10.1.2).\n\nGeneral Requirements\nThe following requirements apply to all lithium ion or lithium polymer cells and batteries:\n(a) cells and batteries identified by the manufacturer as being defective for safety reasons, or that have been damaged, that have the potential of producing a dangerous evolution of heat, fire or short circuit are forbidden for transport (e.g. those being returned to the manufacturer for safety reasons);\n(b) cells and batteries must be protected so as to prevent short circuits. This includes protection against contact with conductive materials within the same packaging that could lead to a short circuit.\nSection II\nCells and batteries offered for transport must meet the provisions of 3.3.2(a) and (e), the General\nRequirements of this packing instruction and:\n1. for cells, the Watt-hour rating is not more than 20 Wh; and\n2. for batteries, Watt-hour rating is not more than 100 Wh. The Watt-hour rating must be marked on the outside case except those manufactured before 1 January 2009;\nCells and batteries must be packed in strong rigid outer packagings that conform to 5.1.2.3, 5.1.2.5.1 and\n5.1.2.8.1.\nAdditional Requirements\u2013Section II\nCells and/or batteries must:\nbe completely enclosed in inner packagings then placed in a strong rigid outer packaging; or\nbe completely enclosed in inner packagings then placed with equipment in a strong rigid outer packaging.\nThe equipment must be secured against movement within the outer packaging and must be equipped with an effective means of preventing accidental activation.\nThe number of cells or batteries in each package must not exceed the appropriate number for the equipment's operation, plus two spares.\nEach package of cells or batteries, or the completed package must be capable of withstanding a 1.2 m drop test in any orientation without:\ndamage to cells or batteries contained therein;\nshifting of the contents so as to allow battery to battery (or cell to cell) contact;\nrelease of contents.\n\nWhere a package contains a combination of lithium batteries contained in equipment and lithium batteries packed with equipment that meet the limits for lithium cells or batteries of Section II, the following additional requirements apply:\n\u2013 the shipper must ensure that all applicable parts of both packing instructions are met. The total weight of lithium batteries contained in any package must not exceed 5 kg;\n\u2013 the words \u201clithium ion batteries, in compliance with Section II of PI 966\u201d must be placed on the air waybill, when an air waybill is used.\nAny person preparing or offering cells or batteries for transport must receive adequate instruction on these requirements commensurate with their responsibilities. Information on adequate instruction can be found in subsection 1.6.\nOverpacks\u2013Section II\nIndividual packages each complying with the requirements of Section II may be placed in an overpack. The overpack may also contain packages of dangerous goods or goods not subject to these Guidelines provided that there are no packages enclosing different substances which might react dangerously with each other. An overpack must be marked with the word \u201cOverpack\u201d and durably and legibly marked with the mark shown in Figure 7.2.A, unless the mark(s) on the package(s) inside the overpack are visible.\nPlease refer to table 966-II for quantity limits and detail outer packaging instruction."}
