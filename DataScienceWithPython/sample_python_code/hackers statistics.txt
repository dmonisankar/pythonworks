Random float


Randomness has many uses in science, art, statistics, cryptography, gaming, gambling, and other fields. You're going to use randomness to simulate a game.

All the functionality you need is contained in the random package, a sub-package of numpy. In this exercise, you'll be using two functions from this package:

    seed(): sets the random seed, so that your results are the reproducible between simulations. As an argument, it takes an integer of your choosing. If you call the function, no output will be generated.
    rand(): if you don't specify any arguments, it generates a random float between zero and one.

--------------------------------
# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# Set the seed
np.random.seed(123)

# Generate and print random float
print(np.random.rand())
------------------------------------

In the previous exercise, you used rand(), that generates a random float between 0 and 1.

As Filip explained in the video you can just as well use randint(), also a function of the random package, to generate integers randomly. The following call generates the integer 4, 5, 6 or 7 randomly. 8 is not included.

import numpy as np
np.random.randint(4, 8)

Numpy has already been imported as np and a seed has been set. Can you roll some dice?
--------------------------------------------
# Import numpy and set seed
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)

# Use randint() to simulate a dice
print(np.random.randint(1, 7))

# Use randint() again
print(np.random.randint(1, 7))

#for i in range(0,10,1):
#   print(np.random.randint(1, 7))

-------------------------------------
# Import numpy and set seed
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)

# Starting step
step = 50

# Roll the dice
dice = np.random.randint(1,7)


# Finish the control construct
if dice <= 2 :
    step = step - 1
elif dice<=5 :
    step = step + 1
else:
    step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

# Print out dice and step
print(dice)
print(step)
-------------------------------------
Before, you have already written Python code that determines the next step based on the previous step. Now it's time to put this code inside a for loop so that we can simulate a random walk.
-------------------------
# Import numpy and set seed
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)

# Initialize random_walk
random_walk = [0]

# Complete the ___
for x in range(100) :
    # Set step: last element in random_walk
    step = random_walk[-1]

    # Roll the dice
    dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

    # Determine next step
    if dice <= 2:
        step = step - 1
    elif dice <= 5:
        step = step + 1
    else:
        step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

    # append next_step to random_walk
    random_walk.append(step)

# Print random_walk
print(random_walk)
------------------------------
Things are shaping up nicely! You already have code that calculates your location in the Empire State Building after 100 dice throws. However, there's something we haven't thought about - you can't go below 0!

A typical way to solve problems like this is by using max(). If you pass max() two arguments, the biggest one gets returned. For example, to make sure that a variable x never goes below 10 when you decrease it, you can use:

x = max(10, x - 1)

# Import numpy and set seed
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)

# Initialize random_walk
random_walk = [0]

for x in range(100) :
    step = random_walk[-1]
    dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

    if dice <= 2:
        # Replace below: use max to make sure step can't go below 0
        step = max(0,step - 1)
    elif dice <= 5:
        step = step + 1
    else:
        step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

    random_walk.append(step)

print(random_walk)

---------------------------------------

Let's visualize this random walk! Remember how you could use matplotlib to build a line plot?

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()

The first list you pass is mapped onto the x axis and the second list is mapped onto the y axis.

If you pass only one argument, Python will know what to do and will use the index of the list to map onto the x axis, and the values in the list onto the y axis.
-----------------------------
# Initialization
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)
random_walk = [0]

for x in range(100) :
    step = random_walk[-1]
    dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

    if dice <= 2:
        step = max(0, step - 1)
    elif dice <= 5:
        step = step + 1
    else:
        step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

    random_walk.append(step)

# Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot random_walk
plt.plot(random_walk)


# Show the plot
plt.show()
-----------------------------------

Simulate multiple walks

A single random walk is one thing, but that doesn't tell you if you have a good chance at winning the bet.

To get an idea about how big your chances are of reaching 60 steps, you can repeatedly simulate the random walk and collect the results. That's exactly what you'll do in this exercise.

The sample code already puts you in the right direction. Another for loop is wrapped around the code you already wrote. It's up to you to add some bits and pieces to make sure all results are recorded correctly.

-----------------------------------

# Initialization
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)

# Initialize all_walks
all_walks = []

# Simulate random walk 10 times
for i in range(10) :

    # Code from before
    random_walk = [0]
    for x in range(100) :
        step = random_walk[-1]
        dice = np.random.randint(1,7)

        if dice <= 2:
            step = max(0, step - 1)
        elif dice <= 5:
            step = step + 1
        else:
            step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)
        random_walk.append(step)

    # Append random_walk to all_walks
    all_walks.append(random_walk[-])

# Print all_walks
print(all_walks)


------------------------------------

all_walks is a list of lists: every sub-list represents a single random walk. If you convert this list of lists to a Numpy array, you can start making interesting plots! matplotlib.pyplot is already imported as plt.

The nested for loop is already coded for you - don't worry about it. For now, focus on the code that comes after this for loop.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)
all_walks = []
for i in range(10) :
    random_walk = [0]
    for x in range(100) :
        step = random_walk[-1]
        dice = np.random.randint(1,7)
        if dice <= 2:
            step = max(0, step - 1)
        elif dice <= 5:
            step = step + 1
        else:
            step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)
        random_walk.append(step)
    all_walks.append(random_walk)
    


# Convert all_walks to Numpy array: np_aw
np_aw = np.array(all_walks)
# Plot np_aw and show
plt.plot(np_aw)
plt.show()
# Clear the figure
plt.clf()

# Transpose np_aw: np_aw_t
np_aw_t = np.transpose(np_aw) 

# Plot np_aw_t and show
plt.plot(np_aw_t)
plt.show()

-----------------------------------------------------------

All these fancy visualizations has put us on a sidetrack. We still have to solve the million-dollar problem: What are the odds that you'll reach 60 steps high on the Empire State Building?

Basically, you want to know about the end points of all the random walks you've simulated. These end points have a certain distribution that you can visualize with a histogram.

------------------------

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(123)
all_walks = []

# Simulate random walk 500 times
for i in range(500) :
    random_walk = [0]
    for x in range(100) :
        step = random_walk[-1]
        dice = np.random.randint(1,7)
        if dice <= 2:
            step = max(0, step - 1)
        elif dice <= 5:
            step = step + 1
        else:
            step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)
        if np.random.rand() <= 0.001 :
            step = 0
        random_walk.append(step)
    all_walks.append(random_walk)

# Create and plot np_aw_t
np_aw_t = np.transpose(np.array(all_walks))

# Select last row from np_aw_t: ends

ends = np_aw_t[-1]
# Plot histogram of ends, display plot
plt.hist(ends)
plt.show()
