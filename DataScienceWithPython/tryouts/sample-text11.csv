IPIC-29141,"Cause of complaint ripes. Oxygen level remained high throughout the transit period and this would have meant the respiration rate of the fruit was higher than envisaged leading to premature ripening during the course of transit.  Of course the situation may have been exacerbated by pre-shipment quality issues."
IPIC-29142,
IPIC-29143,"Impact damage at terminal in Cotonou, as a result cross stuffing required which was apparently done in a rush, and therefore the surveyor did not record damages other than to 4 bags. Onward shipment to China."
IPIC-29144,"Reefer unit was malfunctioning, but with cargo being in apparent sound condition, hence no claim expected. A large amount of ice build-up in the front T-floor and behind the air guide, could have frustrated the air flow and caused the malfunction."

IPIC-29146,"Consignees cause of complaint structure of chocolate filling changed due to temperature resulting in the consignment being rejected. Surveyor remarks chocolate showed nothing untoward but some of the filings are referred to as hard. We would agree with the surveyor the chocolates/biscuits would have retained some residual value, however, the product was branded and we are aware Ferrero do not allow salvage of their products. As to the cause set temperature was 15 C. Logger activated on the 16th November at 20.07hrs. Return temperature 12/13 C. Everything is in order until the 26th December 10.44hrs when the setting is changed to -20 C,  and this remains the case until the 27th 13.59hrs, a period of 27 hours. Thereafter until the 4th January readings are correct. On this basis there is evidence of temperature abuse during the course of transit. However, this does not detract from whether all of the products were actually affected, if the consignment had been allowed to stand for several days would the fillings have thawed, or salvage to mitigate the loss."

IPIC-29150,"Data logger analysis show that the consignment of plums have been carried at dual temperature, which is quite common procedure for plums being shipped from South Africa, however we have not seen any documentation with a formal request for dual temperature from shipper or PPECB. We would recommend that this is compared to requirements in the booking confirmation.Reefer unit has maintained temperature within range of the set point and without indication of malfunction."
IPIC-29151,
IPIC-29152,"Cause of loss wetting to 44 cartons. Cause attributed to condensation. The level of wetting in our opinion is quite severe with subsequent mildew growth and we would suggest enquires are made to determine stowage positions on vessels and whether any repairs were made to the unit prior to reloading. If neither of these avenues of enquiries record nothing untoward then the surveyor is correct and the claim should be refuted on the basis of condensation."
IPIC-29153,
IPIC-29154,"Cross stuffing due to container damage - gash in side of container which also punctured one drum and caused leakage (approx 75%).  Remaining drums (79) appeared sound.Damage occurred at Terminal."
IPIC-29156,"Cause of loss ripes leading to the consignment being a total loss.  According to the surveyors report there were a number of factors giving rise to the condition of the fruit:Prior to the container being gate in full for export at the terminal at Mexico the reefer unit was off from 4th December 2016 at 16.39 hrs until 5th December 2016 at 21.48 hrs resulting in the cooling down period being prolonged whilst the vent setting was closed. Same had in our opinion already affected the condition of the bananas. During the voyage on board the m.v. MAERSK NIAGARA the reefer unit was off for relatively long periods, i.e. from 20th December 2016 at 01.05 hrs until 21st December 2016 at 15.24 hrs, from 21st December 2016 at 15.58 hrs until 22nd December 2016 at 19.35 hrs and from 22nd December 2016 at 20.17 hrs until 23rd December 2016 at 13.29 hrs.This in combination with that the reefer unit being apparently malfunctioning after loading on board this vessel had aggravated the damage. From our review of the data we consider the cause of loss is a combination of periods off power on the 5th and 20th December, high oxygen readings due to issues with the pump over heating. Consequently the respiration rate of the fruit remained high leading to premature ripening during the course of transit. I"
IPIC-29158,"Container shipped to UK by mistake, rather than Portugal. Returned to Colombia. Container full ripes due to transit time."
IPIC-29159,"Cause of loss dull / tired fruit. Surveyor attributed cause to a reefer malfunction between the 17th to 19th December relating to the onset of the voyage. There are some noticeable gaps in the logger readings i.e. 18th December  0300>19th                    140019th                    1900After this period return readings record a rise in temperature. Similarly we are of the opinion cause reefer malfunction."

IPIC-29167,"Cause of damage â€“ reefer malfunction / ice blockage.Surveyor reports high temperatures to product.  However, this was a transhipment cargo, replacement container shipped to Benin and we are not aware from the IPIC portal of any further instructions relating to this.
In the event a claim is submitted we will then comment accordingly."

IPIC-29172,"Data logger analysis show that reefer unit malfunctioned and was no longer able to maintain temperature within range of set point. According to work order in MERC+, container was subject to a live reefer repair, including replacement of both suction and pressure transducers, and condenser fan motor, all of which would have caused the malfunction and subsequent the temperature to rise."
IPIC-29173,"Container was found malfunctioning and analysis of the data logger confirm that reefer was most likely leaking refrigerant and consequently loosing cooling capacity. Cargo was found in apparent sound condition, hence no claim expected."

IPIC-29190,"Cause of complaint ripes, rendering the consignment a total loss. From our analysis of the data logger we are of the opinion the unit was at fault from the onset of the carriage with ""Mevap 2 over heat""  .  As a consequence return air was never under control and the fruit ripened during the course of transit generating more heat."
IPIC-29191,"Fyffes advised duplicated instruction.  SEE IPIC 29190 for survey findings."
IPIC-29192,"1 of 45 containers shipped under the bill of lading. No other reported issues. Cause of complaint ripes. From our analysis of the data logger we do not believe carriage temperature was an issue.Oxygen should have been maintained at 3%. After an initial reduction from the 9th December levels start to rise and this tend then continues to be the case for the duration of the transit. Consequently, respiration of the fruit was higher than requested and most likely lead to premature ripening during the course of transit."

IPIC-29201,"Cargo was found in apparent good condition, however still subject quality check by shipper. Analysis of the data logger show that several alarms were displayed, amongst other related to compressor, current detection, high pressure switch, etc. The various alarms, would most likely explain the malfunction and temperature rising outside range of set point."
IPIC-29202,"Container apparently manipulated and cargo stolen, whilst the container was on a truck for final delivery. Assuming this was merchant haulage, arranged by consignee, hence this is not a transit fortuity and claim due to theft should be rejected."
IPIC-29204,"Impact damage to container..  10 bags milk powder affected by rain water, outer packaging only no apparent damage to contents.  Remaining bags all apparently sound, no facility to 'shrink wrap' therefore it was agreed to cover floor and cargo with  thick plastic sheet."

However, surveyor reports consignee will conduct tests to establish whether they can be used as intended."
IPIC-29210,"Customer Service advise survey allocated to incorrect survey company.SEE IPIC 29214 for survey findings."
IPIC-29211,"Cargo sound, claim withdrawn."
IPIC-29213,"Impact damage to container, requiring cross stuffing of cartons. Some 17 cartons were wet, this is reported to be due to corrosion holes in the roof rather than the result of impact damage. Maybe grounds for rejection as could be deemed shipper should have checked condition of container prior to loading."

IPIC-29215,"Consignment of sweet potatoes deemed a total loss. As identified by the surveyor and recorded by the RCM log the vents were closed and this aspect needs to be verified as whether this was at the instruction of the shipper. Mercantila ""Guide to Food Transport Fruit and Vegetables"" states 0 CBM, however, we are also aware from other shipments of sweet potatoes that vents are open at a host of various settings. Hence the reason for clarification on the booking requirements. Once this information to hand then further comment can be made on causation.Temperature log records nothing untoward."
