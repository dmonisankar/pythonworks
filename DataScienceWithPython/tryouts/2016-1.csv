Our analysis of the data logger does not indicate that any mechanical malfunction took place, although temperatures fluctuated outside the range of set point, which we believe was due significant reduced air flow.Furthermore, the log show that on 18-19/11, whilst still under shippers care, the container was off power for approximately 34.5 hrs, with temperature rising outside range of set point, which may have contributed to an already poor stow becoming unstable as the moisture content of the cartons increased and they became soft and deformed.Based on current facts at hand, we recommend that any claim is rejected and referred back to shipper, due to poor stowage."IPIC-4676,"Cause would not appear to be temperature related.If a claim is presented we will comment in more detail on this aspect together with the other surveys made in Holland during this period all of which are similar.

RCM log records on the 26th, 27th, 29th December and 1st January supply and return air increasing significantly and the reason for this was due to escape of refrigerant and the system on each occasion re-charged.However, the cause of complaint was not ripes but chilling particularly along the container side walls. On the 30th January the unit is off power until the 31st at 15.59, and we believe most likely at this stage the chilling occurred. What we do not know is whose care the container was in at the time.

This remains the case for the duration of the transit.  With the information to hand we consider the most likely reason for the ripes is due to a failure of the CA system combined with a carriage temperature of 14 C leading to ripes and soft green fruit manifesting during the course of transit.

Later during transit, the defrost cycles become more frequent, which is caused by ice build-up in the evap section, behind the air guide and in the T-floor. This was most likely exacerbated by the 21 hrs off power.Furthermore the unit developed a fault on the defrost sensor and the discharge temperature sensor.Cargo was found with high temperature and it is highly likely that consignee will forward a high temperature claim, once the cargo arrives at final destination.We recommend that recovery action is pursued against the terminal in ARPDOPT for not ensuring constant power to a live reefer and subsequent cargo damage."IPIC-5326,"Surveyors comments noted.Unfortunately RCM does not hold the data logger for this consignment, hence we are not able to comment on temperatures and events during the voyage.In the event of a formal claim, we would require the actual data logger downloaded and forwarded, along with a copy of booking confirmation and RKEM tracking details,  for further analysis into root cause and potential recovery."IPIC-5327,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show that reefer unit operated normally, without any indication of malfunction and temperatures were maintained in range of set point during the voyage.However we have noticed that on 12/2, which according transit details in this report is the day after final delivery, the return air temperature is decreasing down  to 0 degree C. This is not reflective of cargo core temperature, as the unit was off power and subsequent the air in the evap section, around the sensors is not moving, but influenced by the cold outside ambient of -10 degree C.Based in the fact, that temperature was maintained during transit whilst in care of carrier and the fact that no loss has been demonstrated, we recommend to reject any forthcoming claim."IPIC-5507,"Surveyors comments noted.Consignee accepted cargo, hence no claim expected."IPIC-5508,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show that reefer unit operated correctly, without any indication of malfunction.After initial pull down, the temperature was maintained within range of set point during the voyage."IPIC-5286,"Surveyors comments noted.It has not been possible to retrieve the data logger from RCM, hence we are not able to comment on temperature or events.In the event of a formal claim, we would require that actual data logger to be downloaded and forwarded for further analysis."IPIC-5312,"One of a number of claims for delay, with the fruit entering into senescence as the shelf life had been reached or exceeded.

This demonstrates that no significant increase in temperature has taken place and that there is no reason to assume that cargo has been damaged.Surveyor said:On 03/03/2016 between 09:00 hours and 12 hours, 3 hours without records.Our comment:According to the event log, unit was off power between 09.55 hrs and until 11.46 hrs, equal to 1 hrs 51 mins total time. As can be observed, the return air temperature is immediately back within range once the unit is powered on, hence we do not believe this to have caused an issue.

Enquires need to be made with the load port to ascertain shippers instructions at the time of booking i.e. Vents closed or open. If the requirement was closed then the claim can be refuted.

MNBU0089901- logger activated 14th April at 09.00. Return air is within 2  of set point after 53 hours.  Ventilation is 5cmh, which we consider to be to low, recommendation 10cmh minimum, preferably 15/.20cmh. Supply/return reading record nothing untoward throughout the transit. No alarms are recorded. MNBU3194731 - Logger activated 14th April at 00.29, return is within 2 C of set point after 71 hours. Supply and return record nothing untoward throughout transit. Vents at 20/50/20 settings during the transit. No alarms are recorded.  MSWU0013241 - Logger activated 14th April at 06.40hrs. Return air is within 2  C of set point after 100 hours, which is much longer than the norm.  Thereafter supply and return readings are in order.  Alarm log records 14/16th April FC high temp.  Air exchange 20/25 during the transit. MSWU9031884 - Logger activated on the 21st April whereas the container was gated in on the 14th. Return air of 15.12 C, reflects some pre-cooling had already taken place. CA system is on with vents opening /closing for 23 hours. From 23.33 on the 21st unit is operating correctly for the remainder of the voyage. Photographs provided by the surveyor show fingers affected by anthracnose, crowns with rots, full yellow with sugar spotting. Diseased fruit will be stressed and therefore will have a higher respiration rate and this can lead to fruit being triggered an irreversible process. Stowage was above the maximum load line at the door end and this will have some affect on the air flow, in addition cartons would seem to be leaning against the doors again affecting air flow. A transit time of 42 days for banavac bags should not be an issue. We have noted pulp temperatures on occasion were below set point and from the photographs some of the fruit has a dull peel. Surveyor has made no reference to chill so we have disregarded this.

The voyage was longer than the norm at 41 days, against 33/34 days but for bananas packed in banavac bags this is not an issue, although with some merit it maybe argued the delay exacerbated the situation. From reviewing the data logger there are 2 issues on the 24th April from 0100hrs until 12.02, when supply and return increase upwards to 19.56C. The other incident is on the 28th, 29th and 30th April when again both supply and return readings start to rise peaking at 33C. On the 1st May we would imagine there was some intervention as both supply and return return to set point. As a result of the elevated temperature the respiration rate of the fruit increased leading to premature ripening during the course of transit which cannot be stopped once the fruit has been triggered. With ethylene and heat generated this can have the affect of triggering other fruit.  "IPIC-6463,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show that reefer unit malfunctioned, resulting in the temperature being outside the range of set point.It is most likely lack of refrigerant causing high supply air temperature."IPIC-6457,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show that reefer unit was operating normally, without any indication technical of malfunction.

"IPIC-6474,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show that the reefer unit was working normally, without any indication of technical malfunction.Furthermore, it shows that this consignment was indeed hot stuffed, with cargo temperatures being around or even above 0 degree C. and it took the reefer unit 8 days to pull down temperature to within 2 degree C of requested set point.The high temperature at time of stuffing, would have caused an excess of liquid (blood and water) to drip into the T-floor, subsequently turning into ice.The fish would also have been soft, causing the bottom layers to fully and/or partly be ""squeezed"" in between the T bars in the floor and thereby obstructing the air flow.All in all, this would significantly have obstructed the air flow and consequently reduced the cooling capacity of the reefer unit.Although it is not unusual to see this type of cargo being hot stuffed, which to a smaller extent is accepted by Maersk Line, this consignment was presented to carrier at an exceptional high and unacceptable temperature.We are the opinion that the high cargo temperature at time stuffing is the root cause for the cargo damage,  consequently we recommend that any formal cargo claim is rejected and referred back to shipper"IPIC-6458,No damage to the consignment as reported by the surveyor.  IPIC-6472,We await surveyors further comments on causation once they are in receipt of the data logger. .  IPIC-6465,"Clearly there was an issue with the low oxygen level in transit and from the 11th May a steady gradual increase in CO2 readings, reaching at the time of delivery 13%.Photographs of the fruit clearly denote brown/black lesions around the calyex reflective of low oxygen/high CO2  with the cellular structure dieing due to the atmosphere within the unit changing from aerobic to anaerobic.

There are no issues with supply or return air readings throughout the transit, and therefore any claim for waste should be refuted. The main issue would seem to be 183 cartons wet. However, we would expect these to have a residual value.  The surveyor  has attributed the cause to leaking roof patches. Unfortunately they have not paid sufficient attention to this point to allow us to be definitive. However, with a reefer container due to the insulation material used it is unusual to have actual water penetration within the container. We consider the most likely cause is condensation from hot stuffing and perhaps the drain plugs being blocked.

Initial survey performed in Walvis Bay on 6th May, with consignees agent in attendance and Mr Werner Ahrens, assumed to be representing CMA/CGM. Assume vessel operators. 2. Maersk Line were not invited to survey at this juncture. 3. Surveyors conclusion consignment defrosted and with a foul smell. 4. Maersk Line surveyor who attended the destruction, reports stowage 7 high 14 across, stacked below maximum load line, and partially beyond the door limits. However, whether this was the case at the original opening of the container the surveyor cannot state as it maybe due to the way cartons were re-stowed.     Back bottom cartons which overlapped the floor grating had been compressed in a manner consistent with defrosted cargo. Particularly the outer most cartons were flush with the floor. 3 of the remaining 5 cartons had partially compressed. Surveyor reports these cartons would have restricted the air flow ,although again he cannot state whether this was the case at the time of the initial opening of the container. Baffle plate positioned flush with the floor grating across the width of the container. Container was gated in full on the 11th March with logger readings commencing at 00.00that day. Return air reflects the consignment was hard frozen at -17.49 C. Supply -23 C.  That same day between 1900hrs until 0300hs on the 12th, supply air increases to -12 C or thereabouts. Return -10/-11 C.  From 0400hrs supply is -22 C, with return dropping to -17/-18 C.Readings are within acceptable parameters until the 6th April when both supply and return increase -10/-7 C respectively, this corresponds to Port Kelang movement. Readings then stop until the 21st April. When they are resumed return readings are -2.48 C.Either the unit was shipped as a non live reefer, or not plugged in by the vessel or reefer malfunction Event log does not support a refer malfunction so we believe the unit was not plugged in on the vessel.Recovery action should be pursued against vessel operators.

The residual water in the container after washing was not drained properly, and it froze into ice when the reefer was powered on.The ice build-up significantly obstructed the air flow, resulting in reduced cooling capacity and elevated cargo temperature. Furthermore, the cargo was found to have shifted and leaning against the doors, whether that was due to the carton boxes becoming soft when the temperature was rising at the door end or if the load shifted during normal operation, is impossible to say.The shifted cargo was leaning heavily against the doors, which made them bulge outwards and this may even have allowed for ambient air to enter the container.The stowage leaning against the doors and the possibility of ambient air entering, would have exacerbated the issues of insufficient air flow, ice build-up and elevated temperature, subsequent causing cargo damage."IPIC-6702,"Clearly the fruit had been affected by low temperatures.RCM  log readings stop on the 4th June at 1600hrs.

Alarm log refers to C02  high and airex open. Oxygen was higher than setting requirements and this is probably due to leakage of the box.

From the 23rd the unit is starting to cool with both supply and return readings reducing.

Oxygen levels from the 8th August start to rise and this trend continues for the duration of the voyage. Alarm log records FC phase loss/ fc over temp all prior to gate in. And on the 14th August just prior to delivery FC loss. If the fruit was loaded to the container between the 19th to the 23rd July, then we are of the opinion either the shipper was part loading the container and switching the unit on/off, or running the unit with the doors open. As a result there was frustration of cooling to the fruit. If the fruit was loaded on the 23rd, then the issue maybe due to oxygen levels above settings from the 8th to the 16th August.

It was evident during survey within cartons selected at random on occasion  there was yellow and green fruit hands mixed together which is more indicative of pre-/post harvest issues rather than transit related problems. In some cases a yellow hand would be surrounded by green fruit. If elevated temperature are the cause of maturity there is normally more uniformity within the carton to colour.  During the course of the voyage return temperature increases above 15 C and this most likely is a result of the fruit starting to ripen and generate biological energy.  There is an issue with the C02 levels that started to increase soon after loading and may account for the odour detected on opening the container doors. The question is would this cause the fruit to ripen. If it was the opposite with oxygen levels high then we would argue yes as biological energy requires a high oxygen level. With CO2  a product of respiration  - as the concentration in the atmosphere rises the product respiration biological energy decreases, known as the Pasteur effect. In extreme cases the atmosphere can change from aerobic to anaerobic, where this is the case the fruit cells can die due to oxygen starvation and turn brown black, this was not seen at the time of survey.   The other effect a low oxygen and high CO2  would have is to reduce the level of ethylene produced from the fruit, a ripening hormone. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the reason for the outturn condition of the fruit was not transit related but instead the pre-shipment condition manifesting during the course of transit leading to premature ripeness. This maybe due to weak fruit or incorrect cutting date, or fruit cut early and delay before under refrigeration.

We believe that the alarms and high temperature are mostly to credited to poor/insufficient power supply, as after the container was loaded to Nicoline Maersk no further issues were observed. Furthermore, there is nothing in MERC+ to support a technical malfunction either.In regards to CA condition, the O2 levels were fluctuating slightly and for most of the voyage being between 9-10%, which may have exacerbated the arrival condition.In our opinion, the insufficient power supply resulted in high temperature and is the root cause of damage. This took place before the container was gated in for export, and whilst the container is assumed to have been in care of shipper (it should be verified that container was not under carrier care at any given time before gate in).Taking above in to consideration, we would recommend to refute the claim due to high temperature and refer it back to shipper.

"IPIC-7988,"Surveyors comments noted.The data logger show that container was off power for 10 days, whilst on board Sealand Illinois, which caused the temperature, CO2 and O2 to rise outside the   range of requested set point.We recommend that full recovery is pursued against the vessel owner/operator, for leaving container without power for 10 days, causing cargo damage.   "IPIC-7990,"Surveyors comments noted.Agree with surveyor, that cargo damage is caused by inadequate packing/stuffing.Due to the stowage obstructing the air flow at the door end, the reefer unit is able to provide sufficient cooling for the entire consignment.Our analysis of the data logger show that reefer unit was operating normally, without any indication of malfunction. The temperature log even clearly demonstrates that reefer unit tried to compensate for the lack in air flow, by partly supplying air well below requested set point, at around -24 to -27.Hence our recommendation is that any claim arising from the damage to this consignment should be refuted and referred back to shipper, due to improper stowage causing the subsequent cargo damage. "IPIC-7984,"Surveyors comments noted.According to the data logger, the level of O2 was high for three days (16/9 to 19/9), which may have contributed to the arrival condition of the fruit."IPIC-7985,"surveyors comments noted.Unfortunately, RCM does not hold the data logger for this consignment, hence we are not able to comment on temperature or events.In the event of a formal claim, we would require the actual data logger to be downloaded and forwarded for further analysis into root cause and potential recovery."IPIC-8026,Low temperatures during the course of transit leading to UPD. IPIC-8031,"Surveyors comments noted.We recommend that terminal is held liable and that all cost occurred are recovered from same."IPIC-8033,"Surveyors comments noted.The data logger show that reefer unit was malfunctioning and displaying several alarms, including ""loss of cool"" which could have been caused by the ice build-up in the evap section, T-floor and behind the air guide.Temperature was not maintained within range of requested set point."IPIC-8094,"Surveyors comments noted.Cargo found in apparent sound condition, hence no claim expected.However the final decision will be taken by consignee, upon arrival at final destination."IPIC-8144,"Surveyors comments noted.The data logger show that reefer unit was displaying alarms during the last 3 days of voyage, mostly related to ""FC high temp"", which caused the temperature to fluctuate slightly outside range of set point at times, but we do not believe that this was the root cause of arrival condition.Furthermore, according to surveyor, the shippers temptale show that temperature was maintained within range of set point during transit."IPIC-8145,"Surveyors comments noted.The data logger show that reefer malfunctioned, due to a defective main relay board. However, the malfunction lasted only around 17 hrs, with supply air temperature going up to around 6 degree C. Container was repaired, where after unit was running normally again.We do not believe this to be the root cause of cargo damage upon arrival.Shippers temptale indicates that temperature was within range of set point during the entire voyage.Hence we recommend to refute the claim on this basis."
