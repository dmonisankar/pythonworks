"IPIC-1087,"The temperature log show that return air at all times was within acceptable limits, with no indications of low temperature.On several occasions the supply air temperature goes down to around 11.5 C.The pattern of damage whereby the lower layers were affected by UPD is consistent with a bottom air delivery system with pulp temperatures dropping below 12.8 C.In our opinion we consider mostly likely the problem occurred in transit. "IPIC-1088,"Without the data logger it is difficult to speculate on whether high temperatures were the cause of the ripes. Pulps above 15 C and in this instance recorded at 16.4 C on ooccassion are indicative of the ripening process being triggered.   With the limited quantity affected approximatly 4% - the most likely cause is pre-shipment issues manifesting during the course of the voyage. However, we note ventilation was set at 80 cbm, which in our opinion is to high for bananas with the norm 10 to 30 cbm, and this maybe a factor. We have recommended the data  logger is obtained and held on file pending a formal claim submitted at a later date. "IPIC-1089,"From analysis of the data logger start of the transit readings are correct. On the 17th December the unit starts to malfunction with high supply and return temperatures and in our opinion this gave rise to the fruit being triggered and the ripes as seen on outturn.

In particular Balboa Terminal did not take corrective actions, although container repeatedly displayed alarm codes 517 & 522. Container was standing in Balboa Terminal for 4 days, which would allow sufficient time to repair or to arrange cross stuffing to a different container in case repair was not possible."IPIC-1099,"No comment, other than shippers Temptale indicates some issue whether power off/ or reefer malfunction. Would concur with surveyors recommendation for data logger - to determine cause and whether recovery action can be pursued against the vessel.  "IPIC-1100,"We would agree with the surveyors comments regarding incorrect supply temperature for the first 9 days of the transit. The pattern with return readings below supply is not disimilar to the evaporator fans moving in the wrong direction. On the 28th, there was some form of human intervention as the supply and return readings rectify and remain so for the duration of the voyage, however by this time the damage to the fruit had already been done. We do not believe the extended voyage time is a factor as bananas in banavac bags should be able to maintain green life in some cases up to 50 days plus, although we would accept it would have exacerbated the situation.  In our opinon them main cause of the bananas ripening is due to a reefer malfunction.  "IPIC-1104,No cargo damage and consequently no claim to be expected.IPIC-1106,"We do not agree with the surveyors remarks on causation.  There are 2 types of packing for bananas, polybag which gives a green life of approximately 22 to 26 days.

The temperature was maintained according to set point during voyage, apart from periods off power during transportation and port operation. It was noted that during a power off period on the 9th February, between 8.31 and 15.10 hrs, the supply air sensors registered the temperature dropping to +10.56 degree C. We believe this is caused by cold ambient air being blown through the open ventilation and past the sensor. This can occur if either the container is stored facing the wind (depending the strength of the wind) or if container is being transported (truck, rail, etc.) facing the direction of transportation. The temperatures returned within range of set point, once container was reconnected to power."IPIC-1240,"Surveyors comments noted.According to temperature log, MSFU8569109 was off power for 139 hrs whilst sitting in MYTPPTM from 18/1-15 to 23/1-15.

Unit struggles to pull the temperature down and this maybe due to the vents open, as only once gated in at the terminal on the 16th, when the vents were closed does the temperature start to fall. And or the baffle plate blocking the air -flow. Currently we are awaiting a photograph of such to try and determine the significance of this.      "IPIC-1357,"Spring onions have a approximate shelf life of 7 to 21 days in this instance the voyage was 18 days.

Data logger requested to see whether recovery action possible against either the third party vendors responsible for PTI of the unit or the vessel for not identifying issue and repairing such.  "IPIC-1378,"Surveyors comment noted.We recommend to investigate reason the delay causing cargo damage, to establish the potential of recovery action. If 3rd party is found and recovery action is pursued, we also recommend that container MNBU3279016 is thoroughly inspected for damage caused by the decomposing onions. The smell of decomposing onions could prove to render the container unsuitable for future cargo, even after several thorough cleaning's, as the smell could prove impossible to remove and the container has to be disposed.   "IPIC-1380,"Surveyors comment noted.We recommend to investigate reason for delay in order to establish if any recovery action can be taken."IPIC-1382,"Surveyors comments noted.In the event that a formal claim is received, we would require the actual data logger to be downloaded and forwarded for further analysis into root cause and potential recovery action."IPIC-1383,"Due to the survey company, failing to use the IPIC portal, survey reports in a narrative format were issued to the local Maersk Line office.They have only recently been registered on the IPIC portal.In the event a claim is submitted, then at this stage IPIC will issue a more detailed analysis on temperature logs and causation."IPIC-1384,"Agree with surveyors comments. MMAU1002743 suffered from loss of cooling, which often indicates lack refrigerant due to a leak in the system. Container had a condenser coil replaced in PABLB end January 2015, and malfunction developed on the 2nd February and could be an indication of repair not performed correctly. Would recommend investigations are made into the reasons for the loss of cooling, and the repair shop are held liable in the interim in case of improper repair."IPIC-1385,"Agree with surveyors remarks, damage appears to be minimal with pre-shipment defects evident. "IPIC-1386,"Surveyors comments noted.Temperature was well maintained according to set point and no indication of any malfunctions.Set point was changed to +7.5 Degree C on 23/1 @ 11.29hrs and back to -0.5 Degree C on 28/1 @ 8.22hrs. This procedure is quite common on fruits coming out of South Africa, as it is often required by PPECB. We do not have the knowledge if such instruction was issued by PPECB, and it should verified against the details in the booking confirmation."IPIC-1387,Surveyors comment noted.IPIC-1388,"The plums were affected by gel breakdown. Carriage instructions were PD1 regime, i.e. -0.5 C for the complete voyage. Scheduled voyage period was 30 days, in this case transit time was 40 days due to poor connections. From our analysis of the data logger correct carriage temperature was maintained. Most likely cause is duration at -0.5 C, ie an additional 10 days causing an affect on the physiology of the fruit. "IPIC-1389,"MMAU10780007 was 1 of 4 containers under the bill of lading with no other reported issues. The question to be addressed is causation due to a breakdown in the coldchain, shifting of the stow causing frustration of the air flow or a combination of the 2.  From analysis of the RCM  log we are satisfied the tuna loins were loaded to the container at the correct temperature. At 23.27 hrs on the 2nd January readings stop and start again on the 4th at 04.27.  At 07.27 the unit is again off power and remains so until 01.27 on the 5th. When power is resumed return readings record an increase of 2/3 C before power out. Therefore, in a 48 hour period the unit is off power for 44 hours. Up until the 25th January, supply and return are in order. On the 25th, return starts to show a rise and this trend continues throughout the 26th, in some cases return reaches -13.2 C which is in line with the temperatures recorded by the surveyors.    In our opinion temperature is a factor and it is possible due to a slight thawing of the consignment the sacks settled, shifted combined with heavy handling of the container leading to slight movement towards the door end creating a partial blockage of the air flow.Recovery action should be pursued against the terminal for the power out period.    "IPIC-1390,"surveyors comments noted.After review of data/temperature log in RCM, as well as repair history from MERC+, it is clear that cargo was subject to high temperatures during the first 8-9days of voyage. MWCU6570053 had suffered malfunction and was repaired during voyage, whilst transshipped in DEBRV. The Malfunction caused temperature to rise to about +20 degrees during the first 7 days, where after it slowly came down to within 2 degrees of set point over the next 1-2 days.  According to MERC+, MWCU6570053 had been PTI'ed in MAAGA by shop 4JQ. However since the container was malfunctioning from onset of voyage, we would recommend to initiate recovery action against repair shop, due to the fact, they released faulty equipment."IPIC-1391,"Surveyors comments noted.There is no indication of reefer malfunction and supply air was delivered at the correct temperatures during voyage. "IPIC-1392,"Surveyors comments noted.Please note that data logger stopped recording the temperatures on the 14/2 @ 00.00 hrs whilst on board the MSC Romanos. This could indicate that container was disconnected from power, however the reasons here fore are unknown. We would recommend that this is investigated and vessel is asked to clarify sequence of events, in order to determine if there is a 3rd party liable and any possibility for recovery."IPIC-1393,Surveyors comment noted.IPIC-1394,"We have now established from the surveyors packing was banavac and not polybag as we thought.

According to MERC+ during PTI frequency converter wiring was replaced, however during the voyage the frequency converter had to be replaced as well.

The alarm was cleared by vessel staff, however returned multiple times during vessel voyage. Based on the data logger and MERC+ repair history, it seems that no other action was taken by the vessel crew, to rectify the problem and save the cargo.The reefer was PTI'ed and repaired on the 7th April by repair shop 4KW, and they did amongst others, leak check, replacing filter drier, main relay board, main controller and evacuate, recycle and recharge the system with refrigerant. Subsequent to this voyage the reefer unit was again subjet to leak check and recharge of the system with refrigerant.Although that the reefer unit had successfully passed PTI, it malfunctioned within days, which does suggest that the PTI and repair quality in repair in shop 4KW, is not of the highest standards.We recommend that recovery action is pursued against the vessel for not repairing the malfunction/not taking proper action to save the cargo."IPIC-1867,"Surveyors comments noted.The data logger shows that during voyage there was 3 power off periods that were slightly longer than normal.

Consequently cargo damage/loss could have been avoided."IPIC-1942,"Surveyors comments noted.according to ML Brazil, the delay between survey instruction (24/4) and the actual survey (15/05), was due to that Martini meat had not received the complete set of documents from Seara, in order to request local authorities for permission to survey/cross stuff the container.It seems that the malfunction started on or about the 6/4, with the unit displaying alarm 24, which is compressor related and on the 13/4 @ 01.41 hrs the event log states ""defrost initiate due to loss of Cool"" and @ 05.42 hrs unit is powered off with return air reading of -14.3 degree C.Unit remained off power until 15/5 when survey was performed.As mentioned, the survey instruction was issued on 24/4, but the container was powered off on the 13/4 due to malfunction, which suggests a 11 days delay between actual malfunction and survey instruction. This could be due to that ML was notified about the malfunction very late, in which case the terminal (assuming it was located at the terminal) should be held liable as this could have caused damage to the cargo.Furthermore, shippers lack of documentation caused a delay of 21 days from survey instruction to actual survey, this would definitely also have contributed to cargo damage."IPIC-1944,"Contents noted, no remarks."IPIC-1945,"Please see attached email from SeaLand Customer Service advising survey instruction cancelled as surveyor was unable to complete."IPIC-1946,Please see attached email from SeaLand Customer Service advising survey instruction cancelled as surveyor was unable to complete.IPIC-1947,"Surveyors comments noted.From the analysis of the data logger, we have observed that there are no indication of reefer malfunction and the temperatures were maintained according to requested set point during the entire voyage."IPIC-1948,"Surveyors comments noted.Data logger shows that temperatures were maintained during entire voyage."IPIC-1949,Maersk Line Customer Service advised this survey instruction is a duplication of IPIC 1678 - therefore this has been closed.

Actual door manipulation and removal of cargo has taken place during the voyage, which seems the most likely. With regards to the manipulation of the container doors and the subsequent theft of cargo, we believe that the most likely it would have taken place whilst the container was stored in ARBUE terminal, due to following reasons.1. container was waiting for 20 days in the terminal, before loading to vessel bound for ESALR. This leaves plenty of time and opportunity to manipulate the doors.2. 887 bags, each weighing 10.5 kgs were removed. This requires time and a place where it is possible to work without looking suspicious3. According to RCM log, the container was off power several times during its stay in the terminal.However the most extensive power off period, was from 14/03 @ 02.51 hrs and until 16/03 @ 17.06 hrs, which equals 62 hrs 15 min. This offers plenty of time and opportunity to manipulate the container, or even move it to a remote corner of the terminal before manipulating it.We recommend that Maersk Line investigate with the terminal in ARBUE the folowing:A. Status of EIR when container was gated in for export i.e was seal present and attached correctly.B. Any sign of door manipulation noted when container gated in for exportC. Request the detailed monitoring report for the entire period that container was sitting in the terminal. Look for any inconsistencies between monitoring report and the unit data logger recording (power off periods, temperature, etc), as this will give an indication if the unit was actually monitored or not. D. Look at the surveillance footage (if available/possible) from the terminal.E. contact subsequent vessels and terminals if any observations were made during the voyage."IPIC-1971,"Surveyors comments noted.Hight temperature developed due leaking refrigerant and consequent cooling capacity problems.

The alarms continue over the next few days, until unit is switched off on the 2/5/2015 and remain off power until 12/05/2015, in total 9 days, 11 hrs and 31 mins.Furthermore it should be mentioned that the malfunction was reported only on the 4/5/2015 to Maersk Line by the terminals reefer service. After the malfunction was reported, it took an additional 25 days before survey/attempted cross stuffing, by which time the cargo was a total loss.The delay was apparently caused by shipper not providing the necessary documentation required for cross stuffing in a timely manner.We recommend that recovery action is pursued against repair shops 2TX and 4JB for poor PTI/repair quality and for releasing faulty equipment to cover this export booking.Furthermore, the terminal should be held liable as well, as they did not report the malfunction until after 6 days, at which time the container had already been off power for 2 days. Timely response from the terminal reefer service department could possibly have saved the cargo.We would also recommend that Maersk Line, in cooperation with the shippers, should review the procedure used in cases like this, as it often seems to be taking quite a long time between notification of malfunction and the actual survey/cross stuffing, which at the end of the day could be the difference between total loss or saving the cargo."IPIC-2156,Consignment considered to be sound.  IPIC-2157,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger confirms that reefer was working correctly and as expected.The initial pull down took around 2.5 days before the return air temperature reached below 14.5 degree C.

Consignee must demonstrate that this is the case and that an actual loss has occurred."IPIC-2178,"Surveyors comments noted.Our review of the data logger show that container malfunctioned and that the temperature was not maintained within acceptable range of set point.The malfunction was due to lack of refrigerant in the system, most likely caused by a leak."IPIC-2179,"From our analysis of the data logger, it has become clear that MWMU6335711 malfunctioned during the voyage, most likely due to lack of refrigerant in the system, caused by a defective/leaking filter drier.Although the reefer had passed PTI on the 01/03/15 at repair shop 4KW, JHT-Ocean Blue Management in INJHT, the reefer malfunctioned within 10 - 12 hours after being powered on at the Jawaharlal Nehru terminal in India. This does suggest that repair quality and inspection procedures in shop 4KW, are not of the highest standard.During the 25/4, whilst still at the terminal, reefer displayed multiple alarms (alarm 19 - Too far from set point), which  were then cleared by someone at the terminal (assume reefer monitor team). However based on the data logger information and the repair history in MERC+, it seems that no proper action was taken and the malfunction was not repaired, eventually leading to total loss of cargo.We recommend that recovery action is pursued against Jawaharlal Nehru terminal, as they during 25/26 of April whilst container was in their care, did not take proper action, which consequently would have saved the cargo."IPIC-2183,"Surveyors comments noted, no issues with the consignment,"IPIC-2184,Surveyors comments noted.IPIC-2185,"Temperature in transit not an issue.

At the moment we cannot confirm whether the surveyors remarks are correct on the disorder is of a pre/post harvest nature.  In our opinion the discolouration to the fruit could be due to CO2  injury. Normally avocado are shipped under CA conditions, in this case it would seem not to be the case, although the vents were closed. We are currently checking with the booking office on the shippers requested settings and will revert. If a claim is presented data logger will be required for analysis.    "IPIC-2192,"Surveyors comments noted.Avocado should only be transported in reefer containers, where the atmosphere (CO2 & O2 Content) can be controlled, which is not the case with MWCU6986652.When avocados are transported in a non controlled CA environment it may damage them and exacerbate any pre existing condition.In case a formal claim is received and as RCM holds no data for this container, we would require the data logger to be downloaded and forwarded to us for further analysis into root cause and potential recovery action. "IPIC-2194,"From our review of the data logger clearly from the onset there were issues with the reefer unit. Supply air is never under control and for most of the voyage temperatures are in the region of 24C.Numerous alarms, i.e. Frequency controller, phase loss, pressure discharge etc are recorded, and although it is apparent efforts were made to try and  address the issues in transit they were to no avail.  Mangoes are a climacteric fruit and as a result of the increase temperature - respiration would have increased leading to premature ripening in transit, and the onset of waste and disease in transit.

At the same time, the unit enters defrost mode due to probe check, Loss of cool.On the 4/5 the set point was changed from -20 to -16.6, this was done manually by the crew on board Maersk Lima, for reasons that are unknownOn the 21/5, whilst container at ESALRTM, the set point was adjusted back to -20.Container did only have a run test, and not a regular PTI, prior released for this booking.This being a chain of missed opportunities to save the cargo, we recommend that all below mentioned parties are included in the recovery process:1) The repair shop for releasing faulty equipment, that is able to supply/maintain requested temperature from onset of voyage.2) The terminal in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, for leaving container off power for more than 24 hrs after discharge and for not taking corrective actions to save the cargo during the 3 days stay.3) Maersk Lima, due that they did not take corrective measures to save the cargo, actually they increased the setpoint temperature via manually input on the keypad, which has without a doubt caused more harm to the cargo. Furthermore they unplugged the reefer almost 20 hrs before actual discharge, 4) The terminal in ESALR left the container off power for almost 8 hrs after discharge. Although they did adjust the set point back to -20, it does not seem that any further actions were taken to avoid cargo damage."IPIC-2215,"Surveyors comments noted.Cargo found to be in sound condition, thus no claim expected."IPIC-2218,"We are aware of several other files reference nos 2179, 2194, 2220, 2494, all relating to shipments of mangoes from India to UAE, with poor outturn rendering the consignments a total loss. Our observations have been hot stuffing, poor packing and subsequent issues with the reefer unit. Recommendation to refute the claims in the first instance. IPIC reference no 2218, follows a similar pattern. Unit was gated out 2nd May and back into the terminal on the 3rd. Data logger is activated on the 3rd at 04.14 with unit off for 15 hours in a 24 hour period. Taking into account the mangoes were not pre-cooled the delay in cooling is significant in trying to slow down respiration and the maturity of the fruit. On the 4th in a 24 hour period the unit is off for 17 hours. This situation repeats itself albeit variable hours off power on a daily basis.Alarm log records FC over current/limit from the onset of the voyage.  There are three aspects to consider, mangoes were not pre-cooled, significant with a climacteric fruit, lack of ventilation holes in the base of the carton, not sufficient for a fruit of this nature with a high respiration rate, shredded paper causing blockage of air flow within the carton and reefer issues. Our recommendation would be the claim is either refuted or negotiated taking into account the above with recovery taken against the third party vendor responsible for PTI, terminal and vessel operators for not repairing/alerting parties concerned of issue with the unit. "IPIC-2219,"The transit time was 14 days whereas the surveyor has commented it should have been 5 days. This in our opinion is a critical factor. We are not aware of the sailing schedule. From analysis of the data logger we can see that some pre-cooling of the consignment had taken place prior to loading. Readings are activated on the 5th, date of gate in. The data logger records the occasional reading of -55C, this we have seen before and is a software glitch and not reflective of the supply temperature.    We do not advocate the mixing of commodities in the same container in this case, mangoes, chillies and limes as they all have different characteristics, physiology and respiration rates.   Out of 3112 cartons, some 329 cartons 11% were lost which reflects our views temperature was not an issue. Quality of the produce is not known and this could be a factor. However, we are also aware that some varities of Indian mangoes have limited shelf life and it may well be 14 days is to long. Similarly chillies have a proximate shelf life of 14 to 21 days. Limes on the other hand should have a much longer PSL as they are more robust and are part of the citrus family. From the photographs provided here the issue would seem to be more rind breakdown ollecolis and waste probably of a pre- shipment nature manifesting during the course of transit. "IPIC-2220,"The container was gated in at the terminal on the 4th May with data logger readings commencing that day and reflecting the mangoes were approximately loaded 4 C above set point. Over the following days return sensor readings slowly drop. There are several readings of -55 C, however, these are software glitches and are not reflective of the temperature within the unit.   From our analysis we are satisfied that the correct carriage temperature was maintained during the transit. As to the cause we consider this is most likely due to the maturity of the fruit at the time of shipment together with other pre/post harvest issues manifesting during the course of transit. Situation may have been exacerbated by only two ventilation holes in the base of the cartons which is not adequate ventilation for mangoes that have a high respiration rate and combined with wrapped in shreds of paper to alleviate bruising again inhibits air flow through the box/pallet.

If we are correct then a transit time of 62 days albeit long would not be the causa proxima, although would have exacerbated the situation.From our analysis of the data logger activated on the 2nd April return temperatures reflect some pre-cooling had already taken place as unit was gated in at the terminal on the 31st March. Return readings are within 2 degrees of set point straight away. Up until the 26th May return readings are below 16C, whilst supply is within acceptable parameters, return from this date is above 16C. This we believe is indicative of heat generated from the ripening fruit. What is apparent is oxygen is never under control and is above 10% for the complete voyage against a setting of 3%. CO2  readings are in order. In our opinion the cause of the ripened fruit is due to a CA failure, with high oxygen levels allowing the fruit to respire at a higher than expected level combined with a long transit of 62 days.

"IPIC-2294,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show that reefer unit operated normally and maintained the temperature within range of set point.However, it should be said that a set point +12.8 degree C. is just on the limit of where banana can start to develop chill injuries (UPD). We would normally expect that set point for banana in standard reefer is around +13.3 to +13.5 degree C. in order minimize the risk of UPD."IPIC-2295,"No data in RCM. In the event a claim is presented, data logger required to comment on causation.  "IPIC-2296,"Surveyors comments noted.Although the data logger retrieved from RCM only contains data of the last 3 weeks (16/5 to 3/6) of voyage, we have observed that the supply air temperature on several occasions go below 12.8 degree C and in some instances as low as 11.6 degree C. Bananas are in high risk of developing UPD, if they are subject to temperatures below 12.8 degree C.Due to the way a reefer container is designed, the air is fed along the bottom, towards the doors, where it then returns to the unit along the ceiling. This supports the surveyors comments with regards to having found bananas with chilling injury (UPD), in some of the boxes from the bottom tier.

"IPIC-2300,"Surveyors comments noted.We have reviewed the data logger for MSWU9073410 and have the made the following observations:1) based on the initial return air temperature, it seem that the orange were not sufficiently pre-cooled.2) From the onset of voyage, the reefer unit displayed several alarms, mostly related to the frequency converter.  Although according to MERC+ there has been registered live reefer repair, the issues were not solved.3) The reefer seems to have been off power for extensive periods during the at ZADUR terminal. It was off power from 14/05/2015 @ approximate 04.00 hrs and until 21/05/2015 @ approximately 08.00 hrs. The last temperature recording is on the 21/05/2015 @17.16 hrs, which suggest that the container was left off power for the remaining time until survey on the 29/05/2015.Based on current information and the above mentioned observations, we would recommend that recovery action is pursued against the terminal. "IPIC-2301,"Container was gated in on the 20th April with the data logger readings commencing at 00.00hrs that day.  The initial return temperature was -16 C, and the unit is working hard to pull the temperature down by pumping in air cooler than set point. Despite this return air remains fairly persistent around -15/-16 C. Certainly the logger does not reflect thawing of the cargo and refreezing. Did the issue occur during customs examination in China, with warm air defrosting the cargo due to duration. On the basis of the data logger recommend repudiation of liability.  "IPIC-2302,"Following various emails to Argentina customer services we subsequently received a survey report issued by Food Partners, covering the cross stuffing operation from MWCU6630002.

Shippers temperature chart records temperatures of 6.5 to 7C more or less throughout the transit. Such high temperatures are not reflected by carriers records. Approximate shelf life of lettuce is 7 to 28 days, therefore a transit time of 21 days should not be an issue. From our analysis of principals there are no excessive periods off power, and supply and return appear to be correct. However, we do have a concern over whether the CA unit was functioning correctly as there are no readings recorded in the temperature log and frequent activity within the event log. To comment further we will require the log in raw format.           "IPIC-2492,"Surveyors comments noted.Container initially performed as expected, however after approximately 2 days temperatures started to increase. several alarms were displayed, caused by issues with either compressor and/or frequency converter.Cargo had to be cross stuffed for the second time within a fortnight due to reefer malfunction, please see IPIC 2392 for information on the initial MNBU3371760 malfunction."IPIC-2493,"This is not the first occasion we have seen high oxygen readings above settings. Higher levels which create the environment to allow a higher respiration than if the levels had been reduced, and as the surveyor have remarked this maybe a factor with the advanced maturity recorded.  "IPIC-2494,"Surveyors comments noted.In the event of a formal claim, we would require the actual data logger to be downloaded and forwarded for further analysis into root cause and potential recovery."IPIC-2495,"Surveyors comments noted.Container malfunctioned due to a defective frequency converter from the very onset of voyage. Container was PTI'ed prior release for export and furthermore a technician was called to troubleshoot the live reefer before it was loaded in MAAGD. There was another 2 live reefer call out, once container arrived in ESALR.We recommend that full recovery is pursued against the depot for releasing faulty equipment for this export booking."IPIC-2496,"Agree with surveyors remarks.

"IPIC-2506,"Surveyors comments noted.Unfortunately RCM does not hold the data logger for this consignment, and we have only received the temperature log in pdf format, without the event log and  the data logger cannot be retrieved as the container has been disposed of.The temperature log show that on the 12th & 13th March, the return air temperature went slightly outside range of set point as it increased to -15.2 degree C, which was partly caused by a combination of power off and defrost mode. After unit was back on power on 13th March, the return air temperature was back within  range after 2 hrs, which indicates that the core temperature of the cargo had not been affected in any significant way.There are also on the 13th registered alarms in the temperature log, however without the missing event log it is impossible to identify the individual alarms.Except from above mentioned, there is nothing in the temperature log that indicates any malfunction and the temperatures were maintained within range of set point.We do not believe that above mentioned temperature fluctuation on the 12th & 13th March are significant enough to have caused the discolouration of the meat. We would recommend to refute the claim."IPIC-2507,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show that reefer suffered from malfunction whilst on board vessel around 18-20/5-2015, and both supply and return air temperature was outside range of set point.The issue was corrected, but temperature was outside range until 4/6/2015."IPIC-2513,Recovery action against terminal Rades for damage to equipment and potential loss in value to consignment. IPIC-2514,"Surveyors comments noted.As the container was delivered in sound condition and with seal intact, it is highly likely that pilferage took place either during/after customs inspection and/or during discharge of cargo from container.In any event this would be outside the control of carrier, consequently no claim is to be expected or should be entertained."IPIC-2515,"Surveyors comments noted.No claim expected."IPIC-2517,"No claim, cargo accepted as sound.

Consequently we believe that the yellow beading/flowering on the vegetable, observed by the surveyor, is related to pre shipment issues. However, the build-up of ice crystals is due to fluctuations in the temperature within the container. This is most likely caused by either extensive power off period and the consequent rise in temperature, or high cargo temperature prior to gate in for export.Our analysis of the data logger show that when container was gated in for export in ESVCI and connected to power, the temperature of cargo was not presented to carrier at correct temperature. The initial cargo temperature was approximately -11.0 degree C. whilst requested set point was -21.0 degree C. The pull down took around 24 hours before return air temperature was within acceptable range of set point. This significant difference in temperature very likely contributed in the build-up of ice crystals within the shipment.Furthermore, the container was off power for a period of 74 hrs 27 min, from 04/04/15 @ 20.52 hrs until 07/07/15 @ 23.19 hrs, after gate out and whilst under the control of merchant haulage.The return air temperature prior power off was  -20.7 degree C and when re-connected to power, it was -8.0 degree C.When the container was discharged in BRPNGTM, it was left off power for a period of 46 hrs 25 min (25/6 @ 14.01 hrs to 27/6 @ 12.26 hrs), which is in clear breach with Maersk Line SOP. The return air temperature reading was -18.0 degree C @ 14.00 hrs on the 27/6On the 28/6 @ 11.31 hrs, container went off power until the 29/6 @ 2.21 hrs. The return air reading ' 03.00 hrs was -18 degree C.None of the other power off periods (load & discharge, terminal operations, etc.) were that extensive nor did they cause significant rise in temperature.We recommend that Maersk Line refute any claim on the basis that, the yellow discolouring of the broccoli is a pre shipment issue, and the fact that consignment was not presented to carrier at correct temperature.Furthermore, the container was off power for more than 74 hrs, whilst under merchant haulage control.In the event, that Maersk Line decide to agree a settlement in part or full, we recommend that recovery action is pursued against the terminal in BRPNG, for leaving the container off power for more than 46 hrs after discharge and multiple times in the time period until gate out for delivery."IPIC-2584,"Surveyors comments noted.the review of the data logger reveals that temperatures were kept within acceptable range of set point.Once a acceptable CA environment been created after initial voyage start, the CA conditions remained within acceptable range of the requested set point.There are no critical malfunctions during the voyage, that could have caused damage to the cargo."IPIC-2585,"Surveyors comments noted.No indication of malfunctions found in the data logger."IPIC-2587,"We are of the opinion loading took place on the 6th June at 6.11hrs and return sensor readings are in line with a pre-cooled consignment.

Container was loaded onto Maersk Bentonville on 20/06/2015 and again there is nothing in the log showing that container was actually connected to power.This repeats itself when the container is discharged in Jebel Ali, however at this time the cargo has been damaged irreversibly.We recommend that full recovery, for all costs involved, is pursued against the terminal in TPP and against the vessel/owners Maersk Bentonville, for failing to connect the reefer to power and consequently causing cargo damage."IPIC-2663,"We have requested details on tracking and booking confirmation of set temperature but to date such information not received.

Return readings at various times during the voyage and up to the 16th June drop slightly below set point, which should not be the case. Thereafter readings are in order. Delivery was on the 4th July. Limes have an approximate shelf life of up to 60 days, so a transit time of 42 days is not an issue, subject to when the limes were harvested.The limes were not presented to the carrier at the correct temperature and this is an factor as it will reduce product shelf life.Reviewing the data logger and shippers Temptale, we are satisfied the correct carriage temperature was maintained. From our review of the surveyors photographs the condition of the fruit would not appear to be dissimilar to sour rot. A pre-shipment condition manifesting during the course of transit. Cause is attributed to a wet growing/harvesting period. Spore laden juices seeping from rotting fruit can contaminate and infect healthy uninjured fruit and cause wetting leading to collapse of cartons.

From our analysis of the data logger there are no issues with carriage temperature. This shipment was under CA - the purpose of this is to extend green life by lowering oxygen and increasing CO2. The affect this has is to slow down the respiration rate. In this case oxygen was never under control and the lowest it reached was 13%, CO2 reached 4% on the 17th June and then started to drop and then from the 29th it was back up to 4/5% increasing to 6% by the end of the transit.  Consequently the respiration of the fruit remained high combined with a transit time of 43 days lead to ripes.Therefore, in our opinion the cause of the ripes and green softness was due to a CA  issue, exacerbated by pre/post harvest diseases manifesting during the course of transit.

From the 16th July return air starts to rise and on the 26th date of delivery is up to 17 C. Temperatures above 15/16 C are cause for concern as can be indicative ripening process has commenced. The main issue with the log as per several other similar cases reviewed is the oxygen levels remain high, only on the 14th July was the lowest reading of 6% achieved. Thereafter readings start to climb with over 12% at the time of delivery.  CO 2 readings are always within acceptable parameters. The purpose of CA  is to alter the composition of the air by reducing oxygen and increasing C02 to control the respiration of the fruit required for a extended transit time of 52 days as in this case. In our opinion the level of oxygen allowed the respiration rate to be higher than envisaged with a setting of 3%, this factor combined with perhaps pre/post harvest issues lead to the advanced maturity of the fruit.

No apparent issues with contents. IPIC-2836,"Surveyors comments noted.According to reefer history in RCM, container malfunctioned from onset of voyage, not being able to supply air at the requested temperature of -18 degree C.The malfunction was most like due to lack of refrigerant, caused by leaking pipes on the discharge side, which is supported by repairs updated in MERC+According to MERC+, container did pass PTI without any additional repairs, but nevertheless the container malfunctioned immediately when powered up.We recommend that recovery is pursued against repair shop C01 in USSAV for releasing faulty equipment and poor PTI/Repair quality which led to the malfunction."IPIC-2837,"Data logger not available in RCM, and require raw data to comment further and to pursue recovery against third party vendor as recommended by surveyor. We are aware that Ferrero Trading globally adhere to a strict quality control protocol often bordering on fear of loss rather than actual loss.     In this case with temperatures of 33.89C recorded at the time of delivery which is slightly above the melting point of chocolate and the surveyors remarks on the condition of the chocolates it would seem there was an actual loss.    "IPIC-2838,"Container was gated out from principals care on the 21st June. Power is on the unit on the 23rd at 05.02 with supply and return at 18/20 C. It is possible the shipper had the unit running with the doors open during this time as humidity readings are high at 98%.At 1700hrs approximately we believe loading took place, with return air at -4.76 C, reflective consignment had not been correctly frozen. Unit was then off power for 10 hours. There are now issues with the supply air fluctuating between plus and minus. On the 25th in a 24 hour period the unit is off power for 15 hours with a further consecutive 7 hours on the 26th. Once the unit is gated in at the terminal on the 26th, from 1200hrs supply and return start to drop, with return within 2  of set point on the 28th at 1300hrs. Thereafter supply and return temperatures are in order.Therefore, we are of the opinion the thawing to the product occurred before the container was gated into the terminal on the 26th, due to a combination of consignment not correctly frozen and a break down in the cool chain before gate in at the terminal.

Activated 27th June, pull down in temperature by the 30th to 16C which is maintained until the 6th July. Unit then off power until the 8th, with the trace peaking at 18C. When power back on trace drops to 15C. On the 9th trace starts to rise again, peaking on the 12th at 22C. Trace then starts to drop back down to 15C, followed by a rise to 18C reached on the 14th followed by a pull down. From the 20th there is a steady gradual rise with 25C reached by the end of the transit. Issue most likely reefer malfunction and or power issues on the vessel as we are aware of other entries on the IPIC  portal for this vessel.

Supply and return are within acceptable parameters throughout the course of transit. Shippers temperature trace shows a similar pattern with nothing untoward during transit. Issues recorded by the surveyor are of a pre-shipment nature manifesting during the course of transit.    "IPIC-2846,"We do not agree with the surveyors remarks that cause is of a pre-shipment nature. Maersk Line data logger is not available on RCM, therefore we are dependent upon the shippers temperature graph. The graph was activated on the 20th June and as to be expected reflects a high temperature with a sharp pull down to 20 C. Container gated in on the 22nd and loaded that same day to the vessel. Unit is then either not plugged in and or malfunctioned, as a result the trace climbs to above 25 C. Only on the 27th when power is resumed does the trace drop to 15 C, where it more or less is maintained for the duration of the voyage. In our opinion the delay in cooling the fruit for 5 days would have been sufficient to trigger the fruit and to have caused softness and the development of disease as seen on outturn.    Possible mitigation maybe crown/neck rot are pre/post harvest issues.   Recovery action against the vessel operators of the Maersk Niamey.   "IPIC-2847,"RCM log records containers activated on the 25th and 26th June. No alarms are displayed and carriage temperature is correct throughout the transit.

"IPIC-2853,"Surveyors comments noted.As surveyor rightfully noticed, on a few occasions both the supply and return air temperature seem to drop to -55.55 according to the temperature log. This is however not indicative of a technical malfunction of the reefer unit, but more related to a momentarily software glitch. Furthermore this type of reefer unit does not have sufficient cooling capacity, which is by design, to reach such temperatures.However we have looked at the data logger, downloaded from RCM, which unfortunately is incomplete, but the data that has been registered do not show any indication of malfunction.In the event that a formal claim is received, we would require the actual data logger to downloaded and forwarded, for further analysis into root cause and potential recovery.

From the onset there are issues with the supply temperature recorded at -1.1 C and return -2.8 C, Over the following days supply and return remain static at these temperatures.On the 8th, from 1300hrs to 07.00 on the 11th, the unit is off power, some 55 hours, and a further 26 hours from 1300 on the 11th to 15.00hrs on the 12th. Only on the 15th at 0400 hrs does supply drop to -15.1 C and we would imagine this was after some form of intervention. Over the following days return slowly drops and reaches -18 C at the time of delivery. Muscle temperatures were said to be ranging from -10.2 to -12.3 C on delivery. Clearly the reefer unit malfunctioned from the onset, and was not rectified by either the terminal in Argentina or the vessel. Event log not sighted so we are unable to pin point actual reason  why. Neither is the log available on RCM. Recommend recovery action is pursued against party responsible for PTI , terminal and the vessel operators.       "IPIC-2902,Surveyors comments noted.IPIC-2903,"Data logger shows nothing untoward with carriage temperature.Initial return air temperatures reflect consignment may not have been adequaetly pre-cooled.

On the 29th to the 30th June container is off power for 30 hours corresponding to loading and on -board Maersk Niamey.  As a result of being off power this would have delayed the cooling down of the fruit possibly leading to weaker fruit being triggered resulting in ship ripes as recorded by the surveyor. Shippers data logger records a similar temperature profile. Recovery against vessel operators.   "IPIC-2907,"We were advised by the surveyors that this instruction had been duplicated.Please see IPIC 2778 for survey findings."IPIC-2908,"From enquiries made we understand the original container no was MNBU3137578 and was gated in full Argentina on the 4th June and loaded onboard the San Antoia. Discharge Bremerhaven on 9th July. For reasons we have been unable to establish we are advised the consignment was cross stuffed into MNBU3137578 on the 16th July. This tends to suggest either a reefer malfunction and or impact damage to the container.  Loaded onboard Bomar Valour on the 20th and discharged St Peterburg on 25th and delivered to consignees on the 29th July. In general terms this is a poor survey report. The surveyor remarks in general the fruit was in a good condition although no penetrometer readings have been taken due to the lack of such instrument. From what we can gather the issue is bruising.Without knowing the extent of damage, and the reasons for the cross stuffing we cannot comment further on causation although we note the surveyor attributes cause to post/pre-harvest issues that indeed maybe the case.     "IPIC-2909,"RCM log was activated on the 5th June and reflects the consignment had been pre-cooled. There are 2 issues with power on the 12th June and the 1st July, alarm log records, high pressure, power frequency, motor evaporator 2 over heat. Shippers Temptales 34640022007 & 3467215513 record from the 12th June trace starting to rise - peaking on the 12th at 9.4C. On the 1st July there is a further issue with the unit off power until the 7th, with the trace up to 16C. Pears are a climacteric fruit, with an increase in temperature/ respiration the fruit would have been triggered and started to ripen with colour break and softness. Transit time of 54 days would have exacerbated the issue. Recovery against the vessel operators.

Furthermore, MERC+ show that PTI was performed prior stuffing, yet still the container malfunctioned from onset when connected to power on 20/07/2015.We recommend that full recovery is pursued against the repair shop 394 in ESALR  for releasing faulty equipment and poor PTI/Repair quality, and against the terminal in ESALR for not connecting the reefer container to power when gated in, but only 7 days later, thus causing damage to cargo. If container would have been connected to power upon gatein to the terminal, the malfunction would have been noticed and it would have been possible to save the cargo."IPIC-2914,"Surveyors comments noted.No claim expected."IPIC-2915,"Surveyors comments noted.As no cargo damage, no claim expected."IPIC-2918,"We are not aware of the original container no. Loading was on the 17th June at Guayquil. Cross stuffing took place in Panama, with the logger for MNBU3164059 activated on the 30th June, with return readings quite high at 18 /20 C.   Once return is pulled down readings up until the 12th August show nothing untoward. Shippers temptale instrument no 2704539340 was activated on the 17th June and reflects an issue with the reefer on the 25th June with the trace climbing to 23 C. In our opinion the cause of damage is attributable to reefer malfunction and delay which in view of the extended transit time gave rise to UPD.  "IPIC-2919,"Logger not available under RCM.Requested discharge port to obtain, to allow comment in more detail on causation. Surveyor has commented following exchange of correspondence that consignment would have retained salvage value.  Only 139 cartons were found out of specification, balance of consignment within. "IPIC-2920,"According to the shippers LogTag the consignment was loaded on the 13th July and records 18.5 C, evidence the fruit was not adequately pre-cooled.  Power is on the unit from 0200hrs on the 14th until 05:42, we are aware the container was gated into the terminal that date but not the time. Unit is then off power for 11 hours, when power is resumed return readings are 22 C plus. Gradually over the following days return readings drop and by the 18th July return readings are within 2  of set point. We are of the opinion the issue with the fruit is due to hot stuffing and bearing in mind avocado are a climacteric fruit - the ripening process commenced at an early stage and manifested during the course of transit.

Return air temperatures do not fall below set point at any stage of the transit. Cause of complaint is chill. Such could have occurred as a result of the extended voyage of 45 days, due to temperature/duration, especially as consignees during the course of the voyage had requested a reduction in setting to 3.5C. As principals are not responsible for delay, recommend claim refuted due to shippers instructions to reduce the carriage temperature to compensate for the extended transit time.

During this period return sensor readings drop to 2.92 C. Therefore, it is possible the skin blemishes the survey report refers to are cold spot injury. However, the quality of the photographs and the description does not allow us to be sure on this point.

We are not convinced this would have lead to the ripes as reported. From photographs taken by the surveyor there are cartons of green fruit with a yellow hand sandwiched between. In our opinion this is indicative of mixed maturity at the time of shipment and or diseased fingers triggering the ripening process. Therefore, we would recommend in the first instance the claim is repudiated on the basis of pre/post harvest issues and in the event this is not accepted then consideration may need to be considered in view of the power off periods.

On the 21st August there is a 18 hour period off power and this would have exacerbated the situation further.

The Tuna was hot stuffed at temperatures between -6 and -7 degree C, which must  be considered inadequate. Furthermore due to that this was tuna in brine (water with a salt solution), it added a significant amount humidity to the environment inside the box, ultimate resulting in the extreme ice build-up in the T-floor and behind the air guide, causing disrupted/insufficient air flow.  This is because the brine does not freeze at -1 degree C like water would normally start to do, but because of salt solution in the water and depending on the strength of that solution, it may stay liquid at temperatures several degree C below zero.There is evidence in the data logger to suggest that reefer suffered from a technical malfunction, as there are several alarms displayed throughout the voyage, amongst others related to loss of cooling and frequency converter."IPIC-3243,"Surveyors comments noted.

It is not clear the reason for this as nothing is shown in the alarm log and we wonder whether these are spurious readings as the condition of the fruit on outturn does not reflect temperatures of 35/44 C which would have triggered all of the consignment as avocado are a climacteric fruit.   Oxygen levels are on the 10th above 12% for approximately 38 hours and this maybe a factor.To summarize ; the fruit was packed 9 to 11 days prior to loading to the container and we do not know the conditions it was stored under.

It is highly likely that the root cause for this is that the Tuna had been brine frozen and thereby introduced high levels of humidity to environment inside the box.The sensor related alarms are caused by the same ice build-up, as at times they may have been partly or fully embedded in ice, thereby causing conflicting controller readings, hence the alarms."IPIC-3424,"We note the surveyor has remarked consignment was in a sound condition.

Shippers temperature recording instrument reflects low temperatures in transit leading to UPD.  "IPIC-3453,"Surveyors comments noted.Due to inventory issues in RCM as well as reefer controller issues, it has not been possible for us to review the actual data logger.The shipper temptale indicates was deviating above what is considered acceptable form set point.The reefer history function in RCM (not to be confused with data logger download function), does suggest that reefer was malfunctioning from onset of voyage, with several alarms and temperatures being outside range.This is supported by MERC+ where a live reefer repair has been recorded in CRLIZ prior container being loaded on board the vessel. However, according to the reefer history in RCM, this did not rectify the issues at hand and in such case the container should not have been loaded, it should either have been repaired correctly or cargo cross stuffed into a different container.We recommend that in case of a formal claim, to pursue full recovery from repair shop 1SL in CRLIZ due to release of faulty equipment and poor PTI/repair quality."IPIC-3454,"Surveyors comments noted..Our review of the data logger show that temperatures were not maintained from onset of voyage. This was caused by reefer malfunction, due to faulty valve plates on the compressor.This is supported by work order update in MERC+.The defective compressor should have been noticed during PTI performed by shop I41 in ARPDO, Consequently we recommend that full recovery is pursued against shop I41 for releasing faulty equipment and poor PTI/repair quality"IPIC-3455,"Surveyors comments noted.However after receiving additional photos showing the door end of the container, before and right after seals are cut and the doors opened.One of the photos is showing doors closed with both seals attached, one at each door handle on the right hand door. Studying the positions of the locking cam's in relation to the cam keepers, it is evident that the lower left cam is not correctly interlocked with the cam keeper, hence the door is not closing entirely and thus leaving a small gap where ambient air is entering the container and causing the build-up of ice and temperature fluctuations.One of the seals was supposed to be inserted into the left bottom cam and cam keeper, as is clearly marked on the container with a yellow sticker, indicating where to place the seal and If shipper would have attempted to do so, he would have noticed that it was not possible as the doors were not closed properly.It is correct that door gaskets have been repaired and some sealer applied, this is not unusual to see on reefer containers. The reefer door gasket is designed with two rubber lips to provide a double seal, which obviously only work as intended, when the doors are closed correctly. We do not believe that the gasket repairs are the cause of cargo being damaged.On this basis, we recommend that any claim is refuted and referred back to shipper.

Shippers Temptale not numbered was activated on the 15th August and covers the complete transit period. From our analysis of such we do not believe temperature was an issue. In our opinion mandarins should have ventilation to remove harmful gasses at around 15 CMH. If the vents were closed from the 19th August until the 15th September then most likely the atmosphere in the container changed from aerobic to anaerobic causing a build up of CO2, cells to die, peel damage, and a fermented taste.

The Tuna was hot stuffed at temperatures between -6 and -7 degree C, which must  be considered inadequate. Furthermore due to that this was tuna in brine (water with a salt solution), it added a significant amount humidity to the environment inside the box, ultimate resulting in the extreme ice build-up in the T-floor and behind the air guide, causing disrupted/insufficient air flow.  This is because the brine does not freeze at -1 degree C like water would normally start to do, but because of salt solution in the water and depending on the strength of that solution, it may stay liquid at temperatures several degree C below zero.There is evidence in the data logger to suggest that reefer suffered from a technical malfunction, as alarm 15 (loss of cooling) which is shown the last two days of the voyage, however this could also be closely related to the ice build-up as a consequence of the hot stuffing."IPIC-3674,"No data in RCM.

CO2 readings are at set point by the 11th September and more or less remain so for the duration of the transit. Oxygen on the other hand remains high and well above settings for the duration of the transit. This maybe due to the unit leaking and therefore unable to maintain a low oxygen setting, consequently the respiration rate of the fruit was higher than expected, leading to advanced maturity. However, we also note the surveyors comments that earlier pick date fruit was more affected and we would suggest in the first instance the claim is rejected on this basis.

According to MERC+ the container was PTI'ed before used for this consignment, but since the same issue with high temperature was occurring from the onset of voyage, it indicates that the PTI was not done properly or at all.On basis of above, we recommend that repair shop 394 is held liable for releasing faulty equipment, poor PTI/repair quality and subsequent cargo damage and that full recovery is pursued against same."IPIC-3738,Surveyors comments noted.IPIC-3740,"Surveyors comments noted.Cargo found in apparent sound condition, hence no claim expected."IPIC-3742,"Cross stuffing report not registered on IPIC issued as a hard copy.

It must also be said that there are several other alarms recorded in the log, mostly related to sensors, which could be separate issues.MERC+ has recorded 2 live reefer repairs during the transit, one in BRRIG and one in ESALR.Furthermore, according the data logger, the unit was off power between the 4th and 8th September, whilst standing in BRRIG.We recommend that full recovery is pursued against the terminal in BRRIG for leaving the container off power for an extended period of time."IPIC-3752,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show that the container was subject to multiple and extensive power off periods between 4 -20 hrs, whilst on board LENA and standing at Rio Grande Do Sul terminal in brazil.We recommend that full recovery is pursued against vessel owner/operator and against the terminal in Rio Grande do Sul, for extensive power off period and subsequent cargo damage as well as all other costs involved."IPIC-3753,"We would agree with the surveyors remarks on probe 1, as we have noted on a number of cold treatment failures to the USA,  it is nearly always this probe. We will raise the issue with CenRef  Ops to obtain their opinion.   "IPIC-3754,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show that requested temperatures were not maintained, due to malfunction of the reefer unit's controller, which was then replaced during transit in HKG.During the periods of malfunction, both the supply and return air temperature was significantly outside range of set point."IPIC-3755,"The report itself is not terribly well detailed and photographs are of a poor quality.RCM log starts on the 18th September and stops on the 21st. Discharge was on the 30th September.  Therefore, currently we are unable to comment on causation. In the event a claim is submitted we will then require the data logger for the complete journey to comment accordingly.   "IPIC-3756,"From our analysis of the RCM log there are no issues with carriage temperature. Humidity within the unit starts at 70% and by the end of the transit is at 94%, corresponding with the atmosphere more or less saturated, this factor combined with temperature would lead to the development of mould spores. Surveyor has attributed the wetting at the front of the unit to blocked defrost pipe and this is probably correct. Therefore, recommend recovery action against the yard responsible for the PTI prior to loading.   "IPIC-3758,"Surveyors comments noted.Our review of the data logger show that the supply air temperatures were within range of set point. However it has also been observed that the return air temperature at times is lower than the supply air temperature, with an ambient temperature above both of them.This is not what you would expect to see with chilled cargo and we believe this anomaly is related to the controller software used for chilled mode.

From our review of the data logger we see nothing untoward, other than perhaps the consignment was above set temperature at the time of loading. There will always be a difference between supply and return sensor readings, and we see nothing untoward with these or significant periods off power.

We consider this must be a spurious reading as it is not possible to loose so much temperature in such a short duration.    On the 28th the unit is off power for 17 hours and return readings are now positive highest reached 3.30 C. Readings stop on the 29th, discharge at Algerciras.

"IPIC-3777,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show that temperature could not be maintained within range of set point and we believe this was caused by two main factors.1) Ice build up in the evaporator section and behind the air guide, significantly hindering the air flow and consequently reducing cooling capacity.2) MERC+ has recorded some pipe repair to the reefer unit upon arrival in ESALR and while stuffed. This would suggest that a leak was present, resulting in low level of refrigerant and furthermore reducing cooling capacity."IPIC-3778,Agree with the surveyors remarks based on the shippers temperature recording instruments issue of a pre-shipment nature and any claim received should be repudiated. . IPIC-3780,"Surveyors comments noted.Cargo found in apparent good condition, hence no claim expected."IPIC-3781,"Consignees rejected the consignment due to delay, bearing in mind ownership lied elsewhere. Transit time was 49 days instead of the norm 24>26 days, and this may have had an affect on reducing the product shelf life, although fruit pressures were still firm and the surveyor makes no reference to the fruit being greasy.

We do not know the reason for this as the log is not available in RCM. Surveyor had identified pre/post harvest issues that most likely manifested during the course of transit leading to premature ripening, similarly it cannot be ruled out if the container was off power the ripening process could have been triggered. "IPIC-3799,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show, that unit was not able to maintain the temperature within range of set point, due to malfunction. In the log, several alarms are displayed in relation to Frequency converter, temperature sensor, loss of cooling, just to mention a few.

When power is resumed return sensor readings are 14 C, an over the ensuing hours return temperature gradually drops, although there is an issue with supply air for 12 hours with supply air up to 10/11 C.  THe next period off power is the 25th August for 9 hours.    To summarize:Product shelf life of limes is approximately 30 to 60 days, in this case the transit time was 45 days. We are not aware as to when the fruit was picked,but a transit time of 45 days should not be an issue. We would question whether the limes had been adequately pre-cooled, as the return sensor readings at the start of the transit 14 C, reflect this was not the case. Temperature and duration are relative to the condition of the fruit as seen and this factor together with pre-shipment defects is the most likely cause. We would recommend enquires are made as to when the container was gated into principals care as readings stop for 11 hours on the 6th August, and at an early stage of the voyage this may have had an influence on the final outturn condition.      "IPIC-3810,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show that temperatures in general were maintained during voyage.It does seem that unit was off power for approximately 18 hrs 42 min on 31/8 to 1/9 2015 and the temperature in the unit section (where the sensors are placed) were recorded at up to around 13 degree C.However this is not reflective of the cargo core temperature, and within 2 hours of being powered on again, the return air temperature was back within range of set point, which indicates an insignificant temperature rise within the cargo.Consequently this is not believed to have impacted the quality of the fruit."IPIC-3811,"surveyors comments noted.both containers suffered reefer malfunction and temperatures were not maintained within range of set point.This could have been caused by ice build-up, causing air flow blockage and subsequent loss of cooling."IPIC-3811,"surveyors comments noted.both containers suffered reefer malfunction and temperatures were not maintained within range of set point.This could have been caused by ice build-up, causing air flow blockage and subsequent loss of cooling."IPIC-3812,"Surveyors comments noted.Despite previous request, we have not received the data logger for analysis.Consequently we are not able to comment on temperatures or events that could possibly explain the cause of damage."IPIC-3813,"Surveyors comments noted.There are currently wide spread quality issues with grapes from Brazil, caused by weather conditions prior to harvest.In case a formal claim is received, we would require the data logger to be downloaded and forwarded for further analysis, as no data available in RCM at this time."IPIC-3815,"In line with the surveyors comments would not envisage a significant claim, if any."IPIC-3815,"In line with the surveyors comments would not envisage a significant claim, if any."IPIC-3816,"There is an issue with the reefer but as we have been unable to access the event log we cannot determine whether this is a malfunction and or the unit off power. The other aspect that needs to be considered is whose care the container was in at the time. Logger was activated on the 15th and there are issues with the readings on the 17th/18th, with the container gated in on the 19th.   This may have a bearing on liability. "IPIC-3817,"RCM logs record nothing untoward until the 10th October when readings stop. Delivery was on the 14th October. Pulp temperatures of between 7 to 8.1C, reflect unit may have been off power, also colour of the fruit more yellow than the norm, due to advanced maturity. Recommend full data logger reading obtained to verify whether power on/off. Recovery against terminal if power was off."IPIC-3818,"Surveyors comments noted.We are still awaiting information on the outcome of cold treatment and the decision in regards to the cargo."IPIC-3819,"Surveyors comments noted.However, looking at the photos and taking the cargo temperatures and condition into consideration, it seems likely that a claim will be made.Unfortunately the data logger retrieved from RCM is incomplete, but our analysis of the available data, show temperatures fluctuating far outside the range of set point.Furthermore, the data logger recordings do not start until 12/09/2015, which is 6 days after gate in for export according to the dates informed in this report, which could indicate that container was left off power for that period. The recordings end on 10/10/2015, which is 5 days prior gate out for delivery, compared to the dates mentioned in this report, and again it could suggest that container was off power.The event log contains multiple alarms related to compressor temperature, most likely because the compressor is constantly working at maximum capacity, which can be caused by low level of refrigerant in the system. MERC+ show that container was subject to 5 live reefer repairs during this voyage, all of them included the repair code for ""add refrigerant""Taking all of above into consideration, we believe that container malfunctioned due to a leak of refrigerant and subsequent low levels of refrigerant, resulting in that temperature could no longer be maintained."IPIC-3820,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show that temperature records are missing on 12 days of the 17 days total voyage time. This is due to power off periods, most likely caused by malfunction which is supported by frequent alarms shown in the event log.In connection with the power off periods, it is evident that there was an increase of temperature inside the box and was not kept within acceptable range of set point."IPIC-3821,"Surveyors comments noted.From the data logger we can see, that after container was stuffed it was off power for more that 14 hrs in an ambient around 30 degree C. This extensive power off period took place before container was gated in for export at Pipavav Terminal in India.There are no indication of reefer malfunction in the event/alarm log."IPIC-3822,"Surveyors comments noted.Data logger show the level of O2 to be high and out of range from set point during voyage, which may have exacerbated the pre existing condition within the fruit.

This would have obstructed the air flow and subsequent reduced the cooling capacity."IPIC-3831,"Surveyors comments noted.The analysis of the data logger show that container malfunctioned from onset of voyage, with several alarms present and temperature deviations, even before the container was loaded to vessel in Puerto Madryn, Argentina. The malfunctions continued throughout the voyage, despite several attempts to repair the reefer, whilst on board vessel in BRRIG and upon arrival in ESALR, some of which were identical to repairs done at time of the PTI.According to MERC+, the container apparently passed a PTI prior to this voyage, at repair shop 3IM in ARPMDNP.It does beg the question if the PTI was performed and/or completed in the proper way, which seems very doubtful.Nevertheless, this container should never have been released for export in this condition, as the machinery was never working properly.We recommend that full recovery is pursued against repair shop 3IM in ARPMDNP for releasing faulty equipment and poor PTI/Repair qulity"IPIC-3832,"Surveyors comments noted.Unfortunately the data logger stored in RCM is incomplete, consequently in event of a formal claim against ML, we would require the actual data logger to be downloaded and forwarded for further analysis into root cause and potential recovery action."IPIC-3833,"Taking into consideration a potential risk of almost USD 140.000, we find the level of quality, detailed description of cargo condition, the lack of recorded temperatures and inspected cargo, to be completely inadequate and unsatisfactory.Surveyor has commented in stage 8 that cargo is in apparent good condition, which we fundamentally disagree with. All the measured temperatures (only 3) in stage 9 are higher than requested set point, and photo 12 clearly show shrimps have changed colour, which we believe will cause consignee to forward a formal claim due to high temperature.We will be requesting surveyor to explain his comment in stage 8 and how he arrived at this conclusion.Our analysis of the data logger show that container malfunctioned from onset of voyage, most likely due to low level of refrigerant caused by a leak in the system. MERC+ show that refrigerant levels were topped up 3 times in time between gate in for export and the time of survey. Prior to voyage container completed a PTI at repair shop 3IM in ARPMD according to repair history in MERC+We  would recommend that full recovery is pursued against above mentioned repair shop for releasing faulty equipment and poor PTI/Repair quality.We have raised the quality of the report up with surveyor and customer service and will revert."IPIC-3836,"Surveyors comments noted.According to information received, the cargo in MSFU8626153 originated from MSFU8620704, but due to unknown reasons had to be cross stuffed.RCM does not hold the data logger for MSFU8620704 and no cross report is available, hence we are not able to comment on temperatures or events leading to the decision of cross stuffing.If above mentioned documentation should come to hand, we would require them to be forwarded for further analysis into root cause and potential recovery."IPIC-3840,"Surveyors comments noted.From our analysis of the data logger, we can conclude that unit was updated with the set point 0 degree c rather than -18 degree C as it was supposed to be.Further more it shows that unit was working correctly and no malfunction was present.It must also be mentioned that unit was running at wrong settings for 5 days before it was gated in full for export. It is assumed that container was under shipper care during those five days and if so, the shipper should have noticed and either taken corrective action or notified the carrier of the situation. Having failed to so, would leave the shipper partly responsible as well.We recommend that full recovery is pursued against the depot in Uruguay for releasing equipment with the wrong settings, against the terminal for not checking and taking corrective action upon gate in for export and against vessel for not noticing the wrong settings and taking corrective action."IPIC-3841,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger show that after the initial pull down, both temperature and CA environment were within acceptable range of set point."IPIC-3842,"We would agree with the surveyors remarks on causation, with the logger recording on the 30th September oxygen readings dropping to 0 and CO 2 starting to climb, reaching 10/11%. Recovery action against terminal and or vessel operators for not addressing the problem and or alerting parties concerned. "IPIC-3844,"There is no argument that the actual settings of the unit were incorrect and set at -18 C for 6/7 days rather than 13 C. However, the surveyor has reported there was no visual/physical evidence of damage to the product, and even went to the level of sampling and whipping the cream to prove this point.  Claimants on the other hand, have not attempted to demonstrate a loss or shown any interest in performing random sampling and whipping tests. We note the product has a 12 month shelf life and it could be consignors have concerns over the longevity of the product after being held at -18 C for several days. This though should not prevent the consignment being sold to a third party to mitigate the loss for whom it may concern.

It is also clearly stated in the Maersk Line BL, humidity settings cannot be guaranteed.we found no indication of malfunction in the event log."IPIC-3852,"Surveyors comments noted.Furthermore, our analysis of the data logger show that temperatures, when container was connected to power and settling after stuffing, were kept within acceptable range of set point during voyage.We found no alarms or any other indications of malfunction, present in the data logger that could explain or have caused the actual arrival condition of the grapes, hence we do not believe that any transit fortuity has occurred.

We are satisfied temperature is not an issue. There were problems with oxygen readings but this would most likely leading to softening if this was an issue. C02 readings were up to 13% against a setting of 5%, and this could account for the skin blemishes with the cells dying due to asphyxiation.

We have no doubts that this extensive power off period will have exacerbated the amount of water ingress, as the ice (water) inside the panels would partly melt due to lack of cooling, and find its way inside the box.We do recommend that repair shop is held liable due to poor repair quality, and the vessel Lena for keeping the container off power for an extensive and unacceptable period of time."IPIC-3907,"Surveyor reports no issue due to short delay.

"IPIC-3935,"First, fruit was severely affected by UPD. Transit time of 65 days is probably the reason for this due to exposure to temperature of 13.5C, for such a long duration. We believe under CA a carriage temperature of 14.5C, is recommended, if this is the case then there maybe grounds to reject the claim if 13.5C was stipulated by the shipper. .

This was most likely caused by a leak and subsequent insufficient levels of refrigerant, resulting in reduced cooling capacity and temperatures above 0 degree C.This is supported by a live reefer repair, updated in MERC+, where refrigerant has been added to the refrigeration system.Data logger from MNBU0243112 show that unit was operating normal and that malfunction was present."IPIC-4414,"Surveyors comments noted.Although the temperature settings were wrong for this commodity, the booking confirmation confirms that the requested set point was 4.4 degree C. which also was the actual setting of the reefer unit upon arrival at final destination.On this basis, we recommend that any claim due to high temperature is refuted."IPIC-4415,"Surveyors comments noted.Although the temperature setting were wrong for this commodity, the booking confirmation confirms that the requested set point was 4.4 degree C. which also was the actual settings of the reefer unit upon arrival at final destination.On this basis, any claim of high temperature should be rejected."IPIC-4416,"Surveyors comments noted.In the event of a formal claim, we would require the actual data loggers to be downloaded and forwarded for further analysis into root cause and potential recovery."IPIC-4416,"Surveyors comments noted.In the event of a formal claim, we would require the actual data loggers to be downloaded and forwarded for further analysis into root cause and potential recovery."IPIC-4417,"Surveyors comments noted.Container is missing the compressor, hence not operational and consequently not able to maintain temperature at specified level.

No major  condition issues with the fruit do not envisage a claim. IPIC-4430,"1 of 13 containers shipped under the bill we are not aware of any other issues.Container was gated in at the terminal on the 22nd October with readings commencing at 18.44 hours on he 21st.   Return air is within 2  of set point after 29 hours on the 23rd October. CO2 readings are more or less on set point from the onset. Oxygen however,  remains high for most part of the transit with readings of 11/12%.As a consequence of the elevated oxygen level respiration rate of the fruit remained higher than required and this factor together with a transit time of 46 days lead to premature ripening and other issues to develop during the course of transit.   "IPIC-4431,"Surveyors comments noted.Our analysis of the data logger confirm that O2 levels were out side range of set point, which in combination with an approximately 38 hrs off power period between causing a rise in temperatures. It must also be pointed out, that as per surveyor statement the CA curtain was not intact.If the CA curtain has not been fitted correctly or at all, the air leakage from the container is to high in order for the unit to get O2 levels under control.This most likely triggered the ripening process of the banana, which is then no longer reversible, hence the findings of banana at different stages in ripening process upon arrival of container at final destination. The delay of 22 days at Port Said in Egypt, before the final delivery took place, will have exacerbated the situation. "IPIC-4435,"Surveyors comments noted.From the survey report and photos it is quite obvious that consignment was supposed to have shipped in frozen mode i.e. -18 degree C.Since the cargo was found defrosted and partly moulded, it is just as obvious that the consignment was transported at a temperature above zero.The booking confirmation state that the customers booking is non frozen, with a set point of +1 degree C.As the customer has been in receipt of the booking confirmation, prior to the consignment being shipped, giving them ample opportunity to verify the details on the booking confirmation and to correct any errors.We recommend that due to the fact that the consignment has been shipped according to the booking confirmation, any claim received is rejected on same basis.

Bananas and one of the only fruits are nearly always hot stuffed. According to the tracking the container was stuffed on the 12th November, however, readings do not commence until the 14th, with the CA system not activated until the 17th. There are no readings on the 18th, but this maybe  down to connection problems with the RCM  system as when power is readings are resumed return air reflects a drop in temperature. Otherwise temperature is in line with set point. Oxygen levels never fall to 3% and remain more or less at normal atmosphere 15/16% for most of the transit. As a consequence the respiration rate of the fruit would have been higher leading to ripes during the course of transit.tHerefore, in our opinion causation is due to delay in cooling and failure of the CA system to maintain the correct oxygen settings. .

We would agree with the surveyors comments on CA not functioning correctly. The fact that only 65 cartons of ripes were identified does point ot pre-shipment issues i.e. crown neck rot, stressing the fruit in transit leading to premature ripening.

The Ryan temperature chart forwarded is in part illegible, but from what we can make out the trace records the correct temperatue was maintained during transit. The disorders recorded by the surveyor appear to be sour rot, Geotricum Candidum which is of a post harvest nature and manifesting during the course of transit - as stated by the surveyor.  As a matter of prudence we would recommend the data logger is obtained in the event a claim maybe pursued by the shipper at a latter stage.

Without sighting the data logger it is difficult to be catergoric on whether the door seal was the sole cause, but in view of the proximity of the wetting and the number of cartons affected it would seem to be most likely.  "IPIC-874,"Due to the poor quality of the Ryan recorder charts we are unable to verify the carraige temperature in transit, however, we would point out we have no reason to dispute the observations made by the surveyor. In the event a claim is pursued we have requested the data logger and will hold on file pending such to allow us to comment accordingly.

We had raised a number of questions with the surveyors on the contents of their report but they have failed to provide answers to these questions. We note the consignment comprised of 1,120 cartons but only 640 were rejected. How can part of the load be acceptable and the remainder not? From our review of the RCM readings which stop on the 30th December, there is nothing untoward with carriage temperature or humidity levels.  We would recommend a full down load is obtained from the unit. In addition if a claim is pursued by consignees. then the surveyors should be called upon to answer the questions raised.  Also we believe any rejection by Ferrero, and refusal to mitigate the loss by salvage options is a commercial decision.

"IPIC-896,"Surveyors comments noted.MSWU9068327 was unable to maintain the correct temperature from the onset of voyage.Taking the temperature readings at time of survey into consideration, it would be expected that a significant part of the cargo would be condemned.MSWU9068327 passed a PTI just a few days before it was utilized  for this consignment, yet still refrigerant was added whilst running live and once cargo was removed, the container had several repairs done due to a leak in the cooling system.We recommend that full recovery is pursued against repair shop that performed the PTI, due to poor PTI/repair and releasing faulty equipment"IPIC-897,Agree with surveyors remarks.IPIC-898,Agree with surveyors remarks. IPIC-900,Agree with surveyors remarks. IPIC-902,Agree with surveyors remarks. Await data/ event logger to comment further on causation and recovery prospects. IPIC-903,Agree with surveyors comments on product shelf life in relation to transit time. IPIC-904,"Need more information on causation, in particular data logger. "IPIC-909,"We would not disagree with the surveyors comments, however with 125 cartons affected we believe it would be prudent for the data logger to be obtained and forwarded to IPIC to be held on the file in case a claim is subsequently presented. "IPIC-911,"In view of only 63 cartons affected we would agree with the surveyors comments that the most likely cause is of a pre-shipment nature. However, as a matter of prudence we have recommended the data logger is obtained and held in case a claim is pursued at a later stage.  "IPIC-913,"The surveyor has attributed the cause to pre-shipment. From our analysis of the data logger - this was activated on the 10th December at 14.15 hrs, unit gated in that day at 12.17hrs. On the 15th unit goes off power from 15.15 to 10.15 the following day, some 19 hours. When power is resumed return sensor readings record a slight increase. (Discharge Balboa)There after supply air is correct and return readings gradually drop as the voyage progresses. Shippers Temptale no AK83107RDO - raises the question whether the grape had been adequatly pre-cooled. It also reflects the period off power on the 15th December and the gradual pull down. In our opinion there are several factors to consider. 1. Had the grape been adequatly pre-cooled. Currently we do not belive this to be the case. 2. Pre- shipment issues as outlined by the surveyor.3. 19 hours off power, may have lead to an increase in respiration, condensation giving rise to SO2  burn, dehydration and softness.          "IPIC-918,"IPIC COMMENT: In order to investigate root cause and possible recovery action, the original event and temperature log is required."IPIC-919,Agree with surveyors remarks. IPIC-920,"IPIC Comment:The fact that reefer was malfunctioning and not able to supply air at the required temperature, was not picked up by the terminal in Itajai in Brazil and therefore the malfunction was not rectified. After the container was loaded to the vessel, the problems with high supply/return air temperatures continued, and the vessel crew did not rectify the problem. Ultimately the high carriage temperatures caused the German Veterinary authorities to reject the cargo to be imported into EU. This incident could have been avoided by the terminal or vessel, if they would have responded to the malfunction and therefore would recommend a recovery action is pursued against the terminal in Brazil and owners of the vessel. We have written to customer services claims Brazil in this regard. "IPIC-921,"PIC COMMENT: One of 5 containers, no other reported issues. In order to comment on causation we require the data logger download to analyze the temperature at loading and during transit."IPIC-924,"No comment at this stage, other than we believe the reefer unit was Star Cool rather than Carrier. "IPIC-925,"There are 2 aspects to consider:1. Product Shelf Life of pineapples is 28 days or thereabouts. Here the transit time was 39 days. 2. The consignment had to be cross stuffed in spain due to a reefer malfunction, although we have not been provided with any details on this aspect. From the comments and photographs provided by the surveyor we would concur the consignment was a total loss.  "IPIC-930,"Surveyors comments noted.Cargo found with high temperature but in apparent good condition, hence no claim expected."IPIC-931,"IPIC COMMENTAs reported by surveyor cause of damage not attributable to a transit fortuity, but under shippers/consignees control.  "IPIC-932,No comment. IPIC-934,"Based on the RCM  log the issue would seem to be low temperatures and not high carriage temperatutre as alleged by consignees. Also all of the varities shipped within the container are temperature sensitive yet some pallets were accepted and distributed accordingly. Therefore pre-shipment issues cannot be ruled out bearing in mind the high pulp temperatures recorded with Luciana variety.   In the first instance we would recommend claim rejected and gauge response for further decisons then to be taken in view of RCM readings below set point.    "IPIC-935,Agree with surveyors remarks. IPIC-936,"IPIC COMMENT: We agree that load has been affected by high temperatures, caused by off power periods during transit. We are aware of a number of incidents on this particular vessel, that currently are being investigated. In order to establish exact reasons for power supply problems, and if recovery action can be taken towards vessel owner or terminal, the data logger would be required for further analysis . "IPIC-939,"From our review of the report we are not satisfied at this stage that all 4 consignments were a total loss and have requested from the surveyor additional information.

Spring onions hava an approximate shelfl life of 7 to 21 days. In this case the transit time was 21 days, and as a consequence the product was entering the end of its shelf life, and as denoted by the surveyors comments and photographs leaf had started to rot, onions bolted with new root growth.   "IPIC-949,"Surveyors comments noted.Cargo found in good condition, no claim expected.Reefer malfunction was caused by unstable/incorrect power supply, which caused frequent power loss and consequently a rise in temperature. The rise in temperature may have been further exacerbated by stowage exceeding the horizontal load line in the container, which caused a reduction in the internal air flow."IPIC-953,"Analysis of data loggers shows no indication of power issues in transit.

"IPIC-954,"As above - surveyors reported this was a duplicated survey instruction and that they had completed their findings under IPIC 958."IPIC-955,"From our analysis of the RCM log, from the onset there is an issue with return temperature that struggles to drop below -15/-16 C.  Supply also fluctuates. To identify the reason for this we required the original download from the unit. However, there are also other factors to be considered as the unit was off power as below:Lae Terminal 25th November 20 hours                      26th  ""                 5                      27th  ""                 11                      28th  ""                 24 Reecon Wolf:     9th December  24Algerciras           30th 31st         31Would recommend terminal and vessels held laible. "IPIC-956,"The transit time of 12 days is well with the Product shelf life of avocado and mangoes. Therefore, the issue is whether the correct temperature was maintained whilst the container was in the care of Maersk Line. Please forward data logger to allow comment on this aspect. "IPIC-957,"Container was gated in at the terminal on the 12th December, with the logger activated on that same day at 12.27hrs. Return temperatures are in line with a pre-cooled consignment. Power was down on the 17th from 05.37 to 10.18hrs, a lapse of 5 hours, on the 18th, 20.16hrs to 03.48 on the 19th, 7 hours, 22nd, 14.18 to 20.32hrs, 6 hours, 8th January 14.53hrs > 17.08, 3 hours.Event log records no alarms. From our analysis we are satisfied the unit functioned correctly, cause therefore is most probably of  pre-shipment nature, manifesting during the course of the voyage, exacerbated by a transit time of 31 days.  "IPIC-958,"Pink rib can be asssociated with low oxygen levels and above optimal storage temperature. Data logger would require analysis if claim is pursued. "IPIC-959,Data logger required to confirm cause of damage. IPIC-960,"Surveyors comments noted. Would recommend data logger obtained and held on file. In the event a claim is pursued it can referred for comment, with an addendum report issued.   "IPIC-962,"Consider steps taken to mitigate the loss to be fair and reasonable.Requested temperature graph so we can comment whether recovery action against third party. Will revert in due course.  "IPIC-963,"Three types of produce in one container should not be an issue as they all have a similar carriage temperature.Shippers temptale no 3495117370 was activated on the 14th December and records the fruit had been pre-cooled as the initial readings are 0.5 C. On the 17th/ 18th there is a brief period off power and again on the 23rd December. We do not believe these are of significance and therefore would concur with the surveyors comments on pre-shipment issues manifesting during the course of transit. However, if claimants pursue the matter, then we will require the data logger to comment further on causation.    "IPIC-964,Surveyor advised that this is a duplicate of IPIC 969.IPIC-966,Would agree with surveyors comments that data logger required to verify whether temperature was maintained during transit.  IPIC-967,"Both the trend chart for the container and the shippers TempTale record elevated temperatures on the 17th January until the 19th with both traces climbing to 8 and 6 C respectively. Some plums shipments are carried at dual temperature amnd this could account for the rise. However, we note from the surveyors comments the carriage temperature regime is not clear and therefore we are seeking clarification from customer services Rotterdam to revert to the surveyor accordingly allowing a comment to be made on causation.      "IPIC-968,"We would recommend download obtained and forwarded to check whether shipment was under dual temperature. On the basis this was not the case then shippers Temptale raises the question whether the fruit had been adequatly pre-cooled - as the trace commences at 5 C. Further we are aware of a number of issues with the MOL Presence and the fluctuations in temperature on the 11th/12th, and again between 17th to 24th where the trace climbs to 9.7 C, maybe due to issues on the vessel. "IPIC-969,"From the photographs provided by consignees we are of the opinion the waste was a result of sour rot, a pre-shipment disease that is particulary prevelant after rain where the spores are splashed up on lower hanging fruit on the tree. Infection is via punctures with the disease manifesting overtime and identifiable  by soft tissue, that melts to the touch and becomes a watery mass with a distinct sour odour. The most likely cause is pre-shipment, however, we have requested the data loggers and will hold on file in case a claIM is submitted at a later date.
