Surveyor remarks chocolate showed nothing untoward but some of the filings are referred to as hard. We would agree with the surveyor the chocolates/biscuits would have retained some residual value, however, the product was branded and we are aware Ferrero do not allow salvage of their products. 

As to the cause set temperature was 15°C. Logger activated on the 16th November at 20.07hrs. Return temperature 12/13°C. Everything is in order until the 26th December 10.44hrs when the setting is changed to -20°C,  and this remains the case until the 27th 13.59hrs, a period of 27 hours. 

Thereafter until the 4th January readings are correct. 

On this basis there is evidence of temperature abuse during the course of transit. 

However, this does not detract from whether all of the products were actually affected, if the consignment had been allowed to stand for several days would the fillings have thawed, or salvage to mitigate the loss."

The level of wetting in our opinion is quite severe with subsequent mildew growth and we would suggest enquires are made to determine stowage positions on vessels and whether any repairs were made to the unit prior to reloading. 

If neither of these avenues of enquiries record nothing untoward then the surveyor is correct and the claim should be refuted on the basis of condensation."

Damage occurred at Terminal."
IPIC-29156,"Cause of loss ripes leading to the consignment being a total loss. 
 
According to the surveyors report there were a number of factors giving rise to the condition of the fruit:

Prior to the container being gate in full for export at the terminal at Mexico the reefer unit was off from 4th December 2016 at 16.39 hrs until 5th December 2016 at 21.48 hrs resulting in the cooling down period being prolonged whilst the vent setting was closed. Same had in our opinion already affected the condition of the bananas. 

During the voyage on board the m.v. MAERSK NIAGARA the reefer unit was off for relatively long periods, i.e. from 20th December 2016 at 01.05 hrs until 21st December 2016 at 15.24 hrs, from 21st December 2016 at 15.58 hrs until 22nd December 2016 at 19.35 hrs and from 22nd December 2016 at 20.17 hrs until 23rd December 2016 at 13.29 hrs.

This in combination with that the reefer unit being apparently malfunctioning after loading on board this vessel had aggravated the damage. 

From our review of the data we consider the cause of loss is a combination of periods off power on the 5th and 20th December, high oxygen readings due to issues with the pump over heating. Consequently the respiration rate of the fruit remained high leading to premature ripening during the course of transit.

IPIC-29159,"Cause of loss dull / tired fruit. Surveyor attributed cause to a reefer malfunction between the 17th to 19th December relating to the onset of the voyage. 

There are some noticeable gaps in the logger readings i.e. 

18th December  0300>
19th                    1400
19th                    1900

Oxygen should have been maintained at 3%. After an initial reduction from the 9th December levels start to rise and this tend then continues to be the case for the duration of the transit.

Alarm log refers to Mevap 2 over heat/M evap 1  over heat and FC  phase loss. Shippers temperature recording instrument reflects elevated temperatures from the onset. 

Cut flowers must be kept at a constant low temperature to prevent foliage, stem and flower degradation as not to do so will cause increase respiration and the release of ethylene and thereby shortening the shelf life. 

We can understand the supermarkets reluctance to sell the flowers to the intended customer as they have to guarantee a shelf life and clearly that had been impeded.

From our analysis of the data logger temperature readings supply and return are correct throughout the transit and we would concur with the surveyor that the issue would appear to be forward maturity at the time of packing leading to premature ripening during the course of transit.

Plantains like bananas are normally hot stuffed and this is a normal occurrence so we would not agree with the surveyor that this was the reason for the ripes. Also containers should only be pre-cooled when loading is from a temperature controlled loading bay. To do so in the tropics leads to condensation and icing of the evaporator and frustration of cooling.  

The critical point here is when the container was gated into Principals care.

Unfortunately we are not in receipt of the tracking details. According to the information provided gate into the terminal was on the 28th December. Data logger readings start on the 31st December 0900, a lapse of several days.  Return readings of 25°C suggest no cooling had taken place.

The PD5 regime calls for supply air temperature to be raised to +7.5°C 2 days after vessel has sailed, and then to be lowered back to -0.5°C after 5 days at +7.5°C.
In this particular case the consignment was held at 7.5°C for 6 days, instead of the required 5 days as per PPECB instructions, however this is in our opinion not likely to have affected the fruit  adversely, hence we agree with surveyor that cargo damage is likely to be of a pre-shipment nature."

Total items found wet damaged: 30 items;
Total items not inspected as boxes were in good external condition: 7 boxes contained 35 items.

Based on our findings, we can confirm the wet damage of about 30 items out of 75 inspected. Our inspection also confirmed that the content of several boxes, which were only slightly affected by wetness, was in good condition. However, due to bulky and heavy boxes, it was not possible for one surveyor to handle all consignment to make it inspected.

Cause of loss defrosting and we would not dispute this fact with blood in the T -bar floors,  and staining on the cartons.

However, the data logger does not support defrosting temperatures. The only apparent issue is on the 31st December when return temperatures start to rise to -15C, and 2 relatively short periods off power but we would be surprised if either of these events would lead to defrosting of the cargo.

Plantains have a estimated green life of 5 weeks, and coloured 1 to 3 weeks. If the fruit was picked green then 18 days is not an issue. If on the other hand fruit was picked with colour which for export would be surprising then 18 days is a factor.

Event log records alarm 14, ""Controller is unable to determine the correct phase relationship""       

There after supply and return readings record nothing untoward. 

In our opinion the most likely cause of ripes is delay in cooling at the onset of the carriage leading to premature ripening due to the release of ethylene a ripening hormone.

For MWCU 5244324, there is no data available in RCM  so we are unable to comment at this stage on causation.

Surveyor reports 1137 cartons of margarine sound, 163 cartons in contact with the floor were wet, possibly attributed to water ingress through floor as no hole observed in container.  Silver nitrate test negative.  

Sachets of margarine on the whole not affected by wetting, only outer cardboard cartons, however a few sachets appeared torn and stained and some cartons grease marked.  Surveyor suggests sachets could be cleaned and re-packaged or sold as retail.

We agree with surveyor that cargo wetting is due to water ingress, most likely the container has been placed in standing water which has entered the container and damaged the cartons.  If the wetting had been caused by condensation we would also have expected to see wetting to top stow and cartons touching the side panels.

Furthermore, the temperature measurement of USDA probes 1 & 2 are recorded in the log, although they often seem vary from one another. The reason for this could be various, such as probes not being inserted correctly into the cargo, probes not being calibrated properly, probes being defective or simply because the cargo where the probes are inserted actually have different core temperature, due to the before mentioned hot stuffing.
USDA probe no 3 has not recorded any temperature, which would suggest that either the cable, sensor or plug is defective, but we found no alarms in the log to support this, or it  has not been connected correctly in the first place, which seem the more likely reason.

Container gated out from the terminal on the 27th January and gated back in on the 28th.  Logger readings commence at 08.28hrs that day. Return air within 2°C of set point after 77 hours, longer than the norm. Part of this maybe due to the 9 hours off power on the 30th.   

On the 22nd February there is an issue with supply air and return readings drop below set point which should not be the case with readings down to 10.68°C. Bananas will chill at 12.8°C. On the 24th supply at 9.92 and return 26.96°C. Return readings continue to increase with 81°C recorded.  On the 26th it would seem the situation rectifies itself as return drops to 16°C with readings stopping on the 26th.

IPIC-30018,"Data logger analysis show that container malfunctioned, displaying alarms related to sensor errors and loss of cooling. The reefer unit suffered a leak of refrigerant, hence it was no longer able to maintain the temperature within range of requested set point. According to MERC+, reefer unit was charged with refrigerant twice whilst live in order to save the cargo.
Attached photos clearly show chicken with signs defrosting (partly covered in ice crystals), and temperature measured at the time of cross stuffing was high and outside the range of set point. As this is a mid transit cross stuffing, it will be up to local veterinarian authorities and/or consignee to determine if cargo has suffered damage, once the container arrive at final destination. However,  with the amount of frost visible on the chicken and taking the temperature fluctuations into consideration, cargo damage is to be expected.
Furthermore, according to MERC+, an estimate was submitted by repair shop 5QU, which included EPTI visual inspection and add 5kg of refrigerant amongst others, but this estimate was rejected and repairs were not performed, hence the container should never have been released to shipper in this condition."

Surveyor remarks chocolate showed nothing untoward but some of the filings are referred to as hard. We would agree with the surveyor the chocolates/biscuits would have retained some residual value, however, the product was branded and we are aware Ferrero do not allow salvage of their products. 

As to the cause set temperature was 15°C. Logger activated on the 16th November at 20.07hrs. Return temperature 12/13°C. Everything is in order until the 26th December 10.44hrs when the setting is changed to -20°C,  and this remains the case until the 27th 13.59hrs, a period of 27 hours. 

Thereafter until the 4th January readings are correct. 

On this basis there is evidence of temperature abuse during the course of transit. 

However, this does not detract from whether all of the products were actually affected, if the consignment had been allowed to stand for several days would the fillings have thawed, or salvage to mitigate the loss."

The level of wetting in our opinion is quite severe with subsequent mildew growth and we would suggest enquires are made to determine stowage positions on vessels and whether any repairs were made to the unit prior to reloading.

Damage occurred at Terminal."
IPIC-29156,"Cause of loss ripes leading to the consignment being a total loss. 
 
According to the surveyors report there were a number of factors giving rise to the condition of the fruit:

Prior to the container being gate in full for export at the terminal at Mexico the reefer unit was off from 4th December 2016 at 16.39 hrs until 5th December 2016 at 21.48 hrs resulting in the cooling down period being prolonged whilst the vent setting was closed. Same had in our opinion already affected the condition of the bananas. 

During the voyage on board the m.v. MAERSK NIAGARA the reefer unit was off for relatively long periods, i.e. from 20th December 2016 at 01.05 hrs until 21st December 2016 at 15.24 hrs, from 21st December 2016 at 15.58 hrs until 22nd December 2016 at 19.35 hrs and from 22nd December 2016 at 20.17 hrs until 23rd December 2016 at 13.29 hrs.

This in combination with that the reefer unit being apparently malfunctioning after loading on board this vessel had aggravated the damage. 

From our review of the data we consider the cause of loss is a combination of periods off power on the 5th and 20th December, high oxygen readings due to issues with the pump over heating. Consequently the respiration rate of the fruit remained high leading to premature ripening during the course of transit. 

I"
IPIC-29158,"Container shipped to UK by mistake, rather than Portugal. Returned to Colombia. 

Container full ripes due to transit time."
IPIC-29159,"Cause of loss dull / tired fruit. Surveyor attributed cause to a reefer malfunction between the 17th to 19th December relating to the onset of the voyage. 

There are some noticeable gaps in the logger readings i.e. 

18th December  0300>
19th                    1400
19th                    1900

After this period return readings record a rise in temperature.

Cause of complaint ripes. From our analysis of the data logger we do not believe carriage temperature was an issue. 

Oxygen should have been maintained at 3%. After an initial reduction from the 9th December levels start to rise and this tend then continues to be the case for the duration of the transit.

Alarm log refers to Mevap 2 over heat/M evap 1  over heat and FC  phase loss. Shippers temperature recording instrument reflects elevated temperatures from the onset. 

Cut flowers must be kept at a constant low temperature to prevent foliage, stem and flower degradation as not to do so will cause increase respiration and the release of ethylene and thereby shortening the shelf life. 

We can understand the supermarkets reluctance to sell the flowers to the intended customer as they have to guarantee a shelf life and clearly that had been impeded. 

However, and as pointed out by the surveyor the flowers still retained a residual value of approximately 15 to 20% and that should be taken into account if settlement is to be considered."

The critical aspect here is the date the container was gated into principals care. We are not in receipt of the tracking details. 

If it was the 31st December at 0600 hours then return air of 16°C reflects some pre- cooling had taken place. From our analysis of the data logger temperature readings supply and return are correct throughout the transit and we would concur with the surveyor that the issue would appear to be forward maturity at the time of packing leading to premature ripening during the course of transit.  High supply temperatures at odd hours at the start of the transit are due to the unit on defrost."
IPIC-29296,"Cause of complaint ripes. 1 of 5 containers shipped under the bill of lading. Plantains like bananas are normally hot stuffed and this is a normal occurrence so we would not agree with the surveyor that this was the reason for the ripes. Also containers should only be pre-cooled when loading is from a temperature controlled loading bay. To do so in the tropics leads to condensation and icing of the evaporator and frustration of cooling.  

The critical point here is when the container was gated into Principals care.

Unfortunately we are not in receipt of the tracking details. According to the information provided gate into the terminal was on the 28th December. Data logger readings start on the 31st December 0900, a lapse of several days.  Return readings of 25°C suggest no cooling had taken place.

Unit is functioning quite correctly and does so for the duration of the transit. Ventilation is 45 CMH.

Summary of findings:

Total items declared for wet damage: 22 boxes contained 110 items;
Total items inspected: 15 boxes containing 75 items;
Total items found wet damaged: 30 items;
Total items not inspected as boxes were in good external condition: 7 boxes contained 35 items.

Based on our findings, we can confirm the wet damage of about 30 items out of 75 inspected. Our inspection also confirmed that the content of several boxes, which were only slightly affected by wetness, was in good condition. However, due to bulky and heavy boxes, it was not possible for one surveyor to handle all consignment to make it inspected. Therefore, we recommend Damco, to unpack all boxes and inspect it content in order to verify the condition of items, which were not accessible for inspection."

Cause of loss defrosting and we would not dispute this fact with blood in the T -bar floors,  and staining on the cartons. 

Data logger was activated on the 1st November and return temperature readings of -18.1C reflect the consignment had been frozen correctly. 

However, the data logger does not support defrosting temperatures. The only apparent issue is on the 31st December when return temperatures start to rise to -15C, and 2 relatively short periods off power but we would be surprised if either of these events would lead to defrosting of the cargo.

Sachets of margarine on the whole not affected by wetting, only outer cardboard cartons, however a few sachets appeared torn and stained and some cartons grease marked.  Surveyor suggests sachets could be cleaned and re-packaged or sold as retail.

We agree with surveyor that cargo wetting is due to water ingress, most likely the container has been placed in standing water which has entered the container and damaged the cartons.

IPIC-29835,"Analysis of the data logger show that cargo, was not presented to carrier at requested set point (it was hot stuffed), and the initial pull down took approximately 8 days before the return air temperature was within range of set point.
Furthermore, the temperature measurement of USDA probes 1 & 2 are recorded in the log, although they often seem vary from one another. The reason for this could be various, such as probes not being inserted correctly into the cargo, probes not being calibrated properly, probes being defective or simply because the cargo where the probes are inserted actually have different core temperature, due to the before mentioned hot stuffing.
USDA probe no 3 has not recorded any temperature, which would suggest that either the cable, sensor or plug is defective, but we found no alarms in the log to support this, or it  has not been connected correctly in the first place, which seem the more likely reason.
As per surveyor, cargo was found in sound condition and based on the information in this report and the data logger, we believe that cargo is fit for intended purpose."

Container gated out from the terminal on the 27th January and gated back in on the 28th.  Logger readings commence at 08.28hrs that day. Return air within 2°C of set point after 77 hours, longer than the norm. Part of this maybe due to the 9 hours off power on the 30th.   

On the 22nd February there is an issue with supply air and return readings drop below set point which should not be the case with readings down to 10.68°C. Bananas will chill at 12.8°C. On the 24th supply at 9.92 and return 26.96°C. Return readings continue to increase with 81°C recorded.  On the 26th it would seem the situation rectifies itself as return drops to 16°C with readings stopping on the 26th.

IPIC-30018,"Data logger analysis show that container malfunctioned, displaying alarms related to sensor errors and loss of cooling. The reefer unit suffered a leak of refrigerant, hence it was no longer able to maintain the temperature within range of requested set point. According to MERC+, reefer unit was charged with refrigerant twice whilst live in order to save the cargo.
Attached photos clearly show chicken with signs defrosting (partly covered in ice crystals), and temperature measured at the time of cross stuffing was high and outside the range of set point. As this is a mid transit cross stuffing, it will be up to local veterinarian authorities and/or consignee to determine if cargo has suffered damage, once the container arrive at final destination. However,  with the amount of frost visible on the chicken and taking the temperature fluctuations into consideration, cargo damage is to be expected.
Furthermore, according to MERC+, an estimate was submitted by repair shop 5QU, which included EPTI visual inspection and add 5kg of refrigerant amongst others, but this estimate was rejected and repairs were not performed, hence the container should never have been released to shipper in this condition."

IPIC-4726,"In RCM the PTI status for MSWU1034911 was updated as ""PTI Required"" by ePTI on 04/10/2015.

According to MERC+ the same container went thru a ""short PTI"" and repairs, which included Leak check, adding refrigerant, replace power cable and plug, replace fuse. PTI and repairs were performed in beginning December 2015 by repair shop 3IM in ARPMD.

However, the data logger does not support this as unit was powered down 15/04/2015 @ 10.18 hrs. The unit the remained off power until 16/11/2015 where it was powered on @17.33 hrs and off again @ 17.41.
In December unit was not powered on until the 24/12/2015 @ 12.41 hrs and it was powered down again @ 12.52 hrs. There are several short power up periods on 24/25/26/27 December 2015 adding up to a total of 22 minutes of run time.
After the unit is powered up on 28/12/2015, the first alarms appear within 9 minutes and they are all power related and are most likely caused by either defective power module PCB, plug, cable or a electrical short circuit in one of the components.

The reefer unit malfunctioned from onset of voyage, and based on the above information it seems that PTI was never performed, although Maersk Line was charged as per MERC+  work order.
The malfunction caused elevated temperatures and resulted in defrosted cargo and damage, hence we recommend that repair shop 3IM is held liable and that full recovery is pursued against same."

Therefore we have nothing to add to the comments made by the surveyor:

--> Container PONU 491 914/6
The goods were not shipped under CA. The delivery air temperature was set at 13,3° C.
High delivery and return air temperatures were recorded at regular intervals during nearly the entire voyage. We noted that, apart from the last days of the transit period, the cooling unit was daily shutting down for a period varying between 13 and 17 hours. We thus may conclude that the cooling was not working properly during the vast majority of the voyage, which resulted in the severe adverse condition of the fruit.

--> Container MMAU 102 881/4
The goods were shipped under CA. The delivery air temperature was set at 14,0° C, O2 setting at 3 % and CO2 setting at 4 %. 

According to the tracking info, the goods must have been stuffed in the container between 11 and 14 January 2016. The container was loaded on board the vessel on 14 January 2016.
We noted that as from 15 January 2016 at 00.24 hours till 16 January 2016 at 00.24 hours, the delivery air temperature was varying between 25° C and 26° C.  Also multiple alarms were recorded in the relevant alarm log.
As from 16 January 2016, the delivery air temperature was decreasing to about 14° C and remained at that temperature during the rest of the voyage. As from 16 January 2016 at 00.24 hours, the return air temperature was also decreasing within 2 days to temperatures of about 15° C during the rest of the voyage. We further noted that during the first 5 days of the transit period, the O2 content was dropping to a minimum reading of 4,76 % (18/01/2016 at 14.00 hours). 
From then on, the oxygen content was quickly rising to values between 15 and 16 % which remained for the rest of the voyage. The CO2 content remained constantly between 4,5 and 5,5 %. In the alarm log, we noted several recordings of ‘CO2 high’, ‘AirEx open’ and ‘Mpump temp high’. Basing us on the aforementioned, it appeared that the ripening process of the bananas must have been triggered during the first days after stuffing of the goods due to an apparent insufficient cooling. The basic principle is that the fruit will generate CO2 from O2 via respiration. This will increase the CO2 level and decrease O2 level inside the container. When the CO2 level reaches above the CO2 set point the vacuum pump will activate and evacuate CO2 with the selective membrane. In case the O2 level goes below the O2 set point the fresh air valve will open and let in ambient air (20,9% O2). We further assume that extensive CO2 production (and thus also extensive consumption of O2) must have taken place in the container, which consequently resulted in high temperature of the vacuum pump (Mpump temp high) and the supply of ambient air inside the container."

IPIC-5167,"Data logger analysis show that, initially when reefer unit was connected to power it was working as expected, however on 20-21/12 the first malfunction incurred, with temperature rising to around -13°C.
On 21/12 @ 17.00 hrs supply air temperature was back in range, followed by return air temperature within 2 hrs, however the malfunction returned on 6/1/2016 and remained until end of voyage (cross stuffing into MNBU0182125), and with temperature rising to around -2°C.
It is very likely that malfunction was due to leaking refrigerant, however we cannot be certain as container was never repaired, but instead sold and longer in Maersk Line fleet.
In our opinion, the malfunction is the root cause for the cargo damage."

From analysis of the data logger and the shippers temperature recording instrument there was an issue with supply and return temperatures at the onset of the carriage, 4th/5th July 2015. Event log refers to a number of alarms, however, we have been unable to establish the meaning of these from the Carrier manual.. 

Shipment was delivered to consignees in August 2015, yet Maersk were only held liable in February 2016, why? What storage conditions were afforded the product during this period, when were samples drawn.  

Consignes have not provided data sheets recording the effect 25°C + would have on the product, and together with cargo insurers refused to release the results of the analysis. Why? We do note the commercial invoice no GBR5117, states""Do not store above 25°C"".

On the 12th at 15.54 hrs set point is changed from 14 to 13.3°C with the CA system switched off. Over the following days at irregular hours in a 24- hour period return air drops below set point which should not be the case - temperatures though do not go low enough to the point where UPD  could develop.

Pattern of damage though as reported by the surveyor is consistent with bottom air delivery system, furthermore return air should not fall below set/supply air. Therefore, we believe most likely the chilling occurred during the course of transit."

Said container was loaded to Maersk La Paz on 16/2 and discharged in ESALR on 28/2.
Reefer unit was operating normally and maintaining supply air temperature according to requested set point during transit.

This consignment was shipped under PPECB dual temperature regime defined as PDZ. In the PPECB manual, PDZ is defined as an ""optional code (via PP04.02-02F01 dispensation route)"" and the details of dispensation is agreed between shipper and PPECB.
With regards to this consignment, it was agreed between shipper and PPECB, that the fruit should be carried with an initial set point of -0.5°C, then 2 days after sailing the set point should be raised to +7.5° and remain there for 13 days or until discharge, whichever comes first, after which it should be changed back to -0.5°C.
We can see from the data logger that set point was changed to +7.5°C on 19/2 @12.18 hrs, and remained as such until 29/2 @ 15.36 hrs, where it was changed back to -0.5°C.
As the container was loaded to vessel on 16/2 and the set point was changed on 19/2, there may be a discrepancy of 24 hrs compared to instructions given to the vessel by PPECB, however we do not have any information of the actual date of vessel departure and furthermore we are of the opinion that this would not be the cause of the alleged damage. 

This consignment was shipped under dual temperature as requested, and we are of the opinion that the carriage instructions was adhered to and that any of the alleged damage was not caused by a transit fortuity, hence we recommend that claim is refuted"

Between the 2nd and 15th February, the reefer unit show multiple alarms related to various issues such as, phase loss, Frequency converter, faulty air vent sensor, suction and discharge pressure, temperature out of range.
In the same period, as indicated by shippers temp tale, the supply temperature is fluctuating from -2.12°C up to +10.6°C. This malfunction is in our opinion what caused the grapes to arrive in damaged condition, furthermore this is very likely to have exacerbated any pre-shipment condition.

The reefer unit displayed the first alarms within 10 min after power up, whilst still in shippers care and they continued after gate in to the terminal, where the container stayed for 4 days before being loaded to Maersk Lamanai still with active alarms displayed.
According to MERC+, there was live reefer repairs performed in both ARBUE terminal by shop 1FM on 5/2 and again by shop 1BS in UYMVD on 15/2, which then resolved the issue.

In our opinion, the container should never have been loaded onto Maersk Lamanai by the terminal in ARBUE with the malfunction still present. Consequently, we recommend that the terminal is held liable and full recovery is pursued against the terminal, for not ensuring that malfunction was resolved before loading or recommending to Maersk Line that cargo should be cross stuffed in case live repair was not possible."
IPIC-5482,"In our opinion there are several factors to be considered:

1. If loading as we believe was on or about the 24th December 2015, the tuna was hot stuffed with return readings of -7.28C. Unit working hard to pull down the temperature with -17C reached by the 27th December. 

2. The tracking needs to be clarified but it would seen the container was discharged in Port Tangier and then shipped to Banjul. Loading was to the Thomas Maersk on the 10th January. Between the 11th to the 15th the unit was off power. 

3. Container damaged. 

The consignment was rejected due to deterioration of the tuna and we believe 40% could be accounted for hot stuffing, 40%, off power, and 20% container damage."
IPIC-5483,
IPIC-5484,"1 of 8 containers under the bill of lading no other reported issues.  

Container was gated in on the 13th February with logger readings commencing at 1100hrs, that day. Return readings are within 2°C of set point after 25 hours. Supply for much of the voyage is slightly above set point and we wonder whether this maybe a factor especially in line with the surveyors comments that the refrigerant tank was empty.  

In the first instance we would recommend the claim is refuted on the basis of the surveyors remarks that the issue was of a pre/post harvest nature manifesting during the course of transit. 

However, if this is not accepted by claimants then consideration may need to be given to some form of settlement."

IPIC-5530,"Our analysis of the data logger shows that reefer unit was operating normally, without any indication of malfunction and temperature being within range of requested set point, whilst on power.
However, we have noticed that unit was off power for two extended periods, the first was from 14/1 @ 18.40 hrs to 15/1 @ 12.48 hrs - total 18 hrs 8 min. whilst on board Svend Maersk
The second was from 24/2 @ 06.57 hrs to 24/2 @ 12.07 hrs - total 5 hrs 10 min. whilst on board MCC Shanghai.
Both power off period may have contributed, but we do not believe this to be the root cause.

Furthermore, we noticed from the photos in the report, that the container is in an overall poor condition. As mentioned by the surveyor, the door gaskets are somewhat damaged/worn out, which may have caused ambient air to enter the container, increasing the humidity and allowing for frost to form on the cargo.
There is also evidence of a large side panel repair on the right hand side, where both outer panel and inner lining was repaired back in December 2009.
The panel seems to be delaminated where it has been repaired, in which case the box insulation will be compromised and heat exchange will exceed the design values. 
The general condition of the box is very likely to have played a role and being a contributing factor in the arrival condition of the salmon."

The temperature fluctuations have been exacerbated by frequent power off events, most of them are likely due to the malfunction. 
However, on 28/2 which was the date of gate in full for export, the reefer was off power from 04.42 hrs to 17.18 hrs, in total 12 hrs 36 min.

The temperature of the fish would most likely have been further compromised, due to the cross stuffing operation taking approximately 6 hrs, in ambient environment.

The original cross stuffing report concludes that the fish have deteriorated slightly i.e eyes changing colour, blood stains and some fish starting to go soft, which seems very much in line with the findings during the final survey after delivered to consignee.

Replacement container MWMU6440506 was operating normally, without any indication of malfunction and with temperature being maintained within range of set point."

In view of the time now elapsed and the assumption on our part that a narrative report has been issued we have closed off the surveyors report. In the event a claim is submitted we can reopen the file and seek further information from the surveyor. 

RCM  records no temperature data."
IPIC-5817,"We have received the data logger for analysis, however unfortunately it is incomplete and does not cover the entire voyage.
Our analysis of the incomplete  data logger that we received,  show that reefer was powered up on 5/1/2016 @ 15.25 hrs, and within 1 hour the return air temperature reached with range of set point, which indicate that consignment was presented to carrier at set point. 

The reefer unit was technically operating normally, without any indication of malfunction or alarms and maintaining the temperature within range of set point.

During the voyage the reefer was subject to power off periods, which normally occur during transshipment and/or port operation, or if the vessel have power supply issues. With exception of 14/2 and 11-12/3 the duration of the  power off periods  are within what is regarded as acceptable. 
On the 14/2 the reefer was off power for 10 hrs 28 mins, and on 11-12/3 25 hrs 36 mins, which in both cases are above the norm. As no tracking details have been provided, we are not able to determine where they took place or to speculate on possible reasons for the extensive power off periods.
The reefer unit was powered down on 12/3 @ 11.24 hrs, and only powered up again on 25/3 @ 13.07 hrs. This equate to more than 13 days off power, which undoubtedly would have caused cargo damage.
Unfortunately the log entries stop on the 25/3 @ 13.12 hrs and although the findings in the survey report seems to indicate that reefer was subject to further power off periods,  we are not able to comment on temperature or events from 25/3 and until final delivery/survey.

At face value, cargo has been damaged due to extensive power off periods, causing the temperature to rise outside range of set point. The pivotal question, is whether the Yokohama CY received correct information in regards to if reefer was live or NOR.
If indeed they were informed that reefer was live, we recommend that full recovery is pursued due to leaving reefer off power for an extensive time period, subsequently causing cargo damage."

After gate in at ARPDOPT and when connected to power, the return air temperature show that the cargo temperature was around -20°C, and that it took approximately 3 days of pull down, before the the return air temperature was within range of requested set point.

Furthermore, the event log show that whilst container was on board Vega Beta, it was subject to approximately 38 power down/up cycles, with the longest single power off period being 5 hrs 47 min.
The day with the longest accumulative power off period, was on the 9/2 which was the day of discharge in BRRIG, with a total of 11 hrs and 11 min.
The frequent power off period on board Vega Beta, indicates that the vessels power supply was insufficient. As soon as the reefer was connected to a proper power source, it was operating normally and temperature was maintained within range.

The reefer unit did not display any alarms that would indicate reefer malfunction.

It is our opinion that the cargo damage is caused by a combination of the consignment being hot stuffed and the frequent  power off periods on board Vega Beta."

Based on the shippers Temptale  2329451488 activated on the 10th March 2016, carriage temperature would appear not to be an issue. The trace settles at 13.8°C shortly after loading. By the 21st March starts to gradually climb and more or less stays at 14.2°C for the duration of the transit.   

The rise in temperature could be due to respiration heat from the fruit as it started to ripen due to advanced maturity at the time of packing, or the CA  system was not working correctly, with the oxygen level remaining high leading to a rise in respiration rate of the fruit rises causing premature ripening.

Relative humidity within the unit is high at 90% and possibly this could be due to surplus water sloshing around the unit following cleaning and or a prolonged loading. We will come back to this issue in due course. 

On the 18th February return sensor readings start to increase and shortly after supply also rises, this trend continues into the 19th. We believe there was then some form of intervention as both supply and return start to drop but this is only for a short period as towards the end of the 19th, both sensors start to rise again. Trend indicative of a gas leak. On the 20th again there was intervention with readings dropping and remaining reasonably stable until the 23rd when they start to rise again up until the 24th. Temperature then remains within acceptable parameters until the 15th March when supply and return shoot up with -10.12°C reached before repairs are made on the 16th. Thereafter, there are no issues with temperature for the remainder of the voyage. 

Merc+ records work repairs were made in Durban for a gas leak with 2kg of refrigerant added and then later on repairs made to the frequency converter which tie in with the data logger readings.     

The other issues that may have exacerbated the situation are ice blockage around the t-bar floor at the front of the unit and under the baffle plate that was displaced by 6cms, all contributing to temperature fluctuation within the unit. This could be attributed to surplus water in the unit from the onset, or blocked defrost pipe leading to overspill of water from the drip tray, falling and freezing on contact with the floor.  

As a consequence of the fluctuating temperature those cartons closest to the side walls and across the top of the stow were subjected to a rise in temperature due to convection leading to partial defrosting and ice crystal formation when power re-applied.

Cause of loss reefer malfunction.  However, as a point of mitigation it would seem the cargo was not presented to the carrier at the correct temperature and as a consequence when frozen down further ice crystal would have formed."

1. The onions were hot stuffed, with a temperature around +37°C, compared to the requested carriage temperature of +1°C. This indicates that the onions were stored under ambient conditions, rather than in a cold store.
2. Initially the reefer unit managed to pull down the temperature of the load to around +8°C, before the reefer unit malfunctioned 5 days into the voyage and was no longer able to maintain the temperature within range of set point, 

It is our opinion that the high storage temperature prior being stuffed into the container, would have caused damage to the onions, which has been exacerbated by the fluctuating temperatures caused by the reefer malfunction."

It is our opinion that the hot stuffing, combined with the way that the mango was packed in the box, with excessive amount of shredded paper, would have led to the mango arriving in a mature and soft condition, even with the container operating normally.

There was issues with the reefer unit, as it seem to have malfunctioned from onset of voyage. However we do not believe that the malfunction was the primary cause of cargo damage, but merely exacerbating the issues already existing within the fruit.

As per PTI history in RCM, MWCU6283006 was updated with ""no PTI required"" on the 27/04/2016 and container was released to shipper on 28/04/2016.
Reefer was gated back in for export on the 28/04/2016 and loaded to the vessel on 30/04/2016.

Based on above observations, we recommend to refute the claim in the first instance, due to the hot stuffing and the excessive amount of shredded paper obstructing the air flow.
If on the other hand it is decided to settle the claim, partially or fully, the export port in India should be held liable as the container was sitting there for 2 days with malfunction, without any apparent attempt being made to save the cargo."

On the 12th May, at 23.33hrs readings stop, and when they are again displayed on the 14th both supply and return air start to rise continuing on the 15th with 20°C plus reached.  Midday from the 15th, readings start to drop back towards set point and temperatures remain within acceptable parameters thereafter.

Alarm log refers to M evaporator 1 over heat, and M cond over heat for most of the transit.  Surveyor reports the issue as UPD and not ripes. Data logger does not record low readings to cause UPD.   

Shippers Temptale 2329452154 activated on the 5th April 0300hrs, records readings in fahrenheit. Converted into centigrade at the start of the transit trace drops to 12.5°C,  followed by a rise in temperature and then back to 12.5°C and settling at 13.3°C until the next period off power, and back to 13.3°C, until the 26th May, trace then starts to drop 12.5°C and hovers around this level for the duration of the transit.    

We are surprised the cause of complaint is not ripes and both data loggers would support this. Principals data logger readings do not support UPD, shippers readings do however.

Looking at the pattern of the actual supply air temperature and the MERC+ repair history, it seems likely that the malfunction was caused by defective socket relays.

According to RCM the PTI status was updated as unknown on 16/05/2016, which is believed to at the time of gate out empty for export. 
Although PTI status was unknown, the depot only did a visual inspection and cleaning of the container, they never ensured that the reefer unit was in good working order, hence we recommend that the depot is held liable and that recovery is pursued."

It took 6 days before the temperature was back within range of set point. 
Unit remained displaying alarms, until controller was replaced during vessel call in BRSSZ.

As the container was malfunctioning, and it took 6 days to get temperature back within range, it could be argued that the crew on board Vega Omikron did not react in a timely manner. 
This would depend upon if, what and when actions were taken, I.E. were repairs performed, was ML informed, did they send malref to EMR vessel support for assistance, etc, which is information that is unavailable to IPIC.

Furthermore, after discharge in BRRIG on 24/5 and until day of loading to Maersk Lima on 29/5 the data in the logger is missing. When comparing the temperatures before and after the missing data, it strongly suggests that unit was off power as the temperature has increased by 11 degree C.
Whether this is due to malfunction or that the unit was simply not connected to power is unknown, but regardless the reason, it seems quite evident that proper action was not taken in a timely manner by the terminal.

We agree with surveyor that the periods with elevated temperature is the root cause of the cargo damage.

Consequently, we would recommend that vessel owner/operator is put on notice, as it then will be up to the vessel to demonstrate that proper action was taken in a timely manner, unless this information in already known to GLBCLM.

Furthermore, the terminal in BRRIG should be held liable as well, due to inadequate power supply and/or not correcting the reefer malfunction in a timely manner, in order to protect the cargo and they should never have allowed the container to continue the voyage until these issues had been completely solved."

Pulp temperatures ranging between 17.1 to 19.2°C, indicative fruit had been triggered. 

Container gated in for loading on the 20th May, with readings commencing that day at 18.56 hrs. Return within 2°C of set point after 54 hours. Up until the 15th June return air below 15°C, from then onwards it starts to rise above and is maintained for the duration of the voyage.     

Shippers Temptale no 2329350847 activated on the 20th May records a quick pull down to 14.4°C, with the trace maintained at 14.4°C until the 4th June when there is a slight drop to 13.8°C, before a gradual climb which is then consistent for the duration of the voyage peaking at 15.8°C at the end of the transit. 

In our opinion cause of damage is attributable to pre-shipment defects manifesting during  the course of transit and the claim should be repudiated."

IPIC-6852,"The surveyor has corrected the dates, which should have read June instead of July. We have attached his revised narrative report, and the corrected information can be found in section 4.

With regards to the reefer malfunction, container had passed EPTI and consequently there was no need for an actual physical PTI, but only a visual inspection. This particular type of malfunction, would most likely not be possible to discover during the visual inspection.
It would be expected that the vessel carrying the container, would have contacted EMR vessel support to seek guidance on fault and subsequent repairs, then it would be a matter if they had the required spare parts on board.
However, if the vessel did not take any preventive action to save the cargo i.e repairs or making contact with vessel support, we would recommend that they are held liable, as the cargo could most likely have been saved with the action."

IPIC-6899,"Issue ripes and discoloured soft fruit with 200 cartons received in a sound condition and the balance 1,000 cartons, 65% depreciation. Surveyor not identified within the report this was CA  shipment or commented on causation.  

Logger readings were activated on the 20th May and return air of 14.20 °C reflects some cooling had already taken place.  Gaseous readings also reflect CA  system activated.  Carriage temperature is not an issue although towards the end of the transit return air increases by a degree that maybe attributable to the fruit start to release heat from ripening. Oxygen slowly drops during the course of transit reaching 5.60% on the 18th June against a setting of 3%. Thereafter the readings start to climb with 14% reached by the end of the transit on the 24th June. 

It is not clear from the RCM  log why oxygen started to increase from the 18th June onwards. 

Shippers Logtag 2030191152 was activated on the 6th May, which would mean a transit time of 49 days. 

It is possible the elevated oxygen levels increased the respiration rate of the fruit leading to premature ripening  combined with a 49 day transit.  However, it is also possible the pre-shipment condition of the fruit may also have been a factor and would recommend in this instance a negotiated settlement. If consignees refuse such then consideration will need to be given of the claim bearing in mind the gaseous readings."

Level of softness was according to the surveyor:

It is also unknown if the vessel issued any malref and contacted CENEMR vessel support, and/or if any repair was attempted on their side.

The ice build-up could have been caused by overflowing water during defrost due to a blocked drain."
IPIC-7022,"Tuna was hot stuffed and loaded into the container with a core temperature around -5 to -6°C,  which would result in high humidity levels and frequent defrost cycles. 
It is very likely that the defrost drain was unable to cope with the amount of defrost water, which then overflowed into the area behind the air guide, causing a massive ice build-up when unit resumed normal operation.
The ice completely blocked the air flow, causing reduced cooling capacity and subsequently elevated cargo temperature and damage."
IPIC-7023,"We agree with surveyor that the brine frozen tuna (it is assumed to be brine frozen), was not presented to carrier at requested set point. Our previous experience with brine frozen tuna, being hot stuffed, is that humidity levels inside the container increase, which often will lead to massive ice build-up in the T-floor and behind the air guide. This will have a significant negative impact on the air flow, which subsequently reduce the cooling capacity of the reefer unit.
However, our analysis of the data logger also suggests that there is an element of reefer malfunction in this case, as there are quite a few alarms, mostly related to sensor errors. We agree that some of these alarms may have been caused by the hot stuffing and the suspected subsequent ice build-up, but we also found work orders in MERC+ where sensor and frequency converter had been replaced in live reefer repair mode, which support that there is an element of malfunction as well.

We recommend to reject the claim in the first instance, due to hot stuffing. However, if claimant does not accept this and wishes to pursue the matter, we recommend that options are reconsidered, as there is an element of reefer malfunction. A settlement with claimant will then possibly being the best course of action."
IPIC-7024,"CA  shipment. Issue ripes and discoloured fruit with 750 cartons out of 1200 rejected.  

We do not agree with the surveyors comments on causation being of a pre-shipment nature. First the surveyor makes no reference to the fact this was a CA  shipment. Bananas are one of the few fruits that are not pre-cooled and are regularly hot stuffed. 

Logger readings commence on the 22nd May and return air is within 2°C of set point after 34 hours, all quite normal. 

Correct supply and return temperatures are maintained throughout the 51 day transit. There is a 10 hour period off power on the 8th July and when power is resumed return air is approximately 1°C higher.  Shippers LogTag 2030191162 reflects the above remarks. 

Concerning gaseous readings up until the 19th June the CA  system is functioning correctly. From 0900 hours onwards oxygen is recorded to 0 and the alarm log refers to low oxygen. CO2 also drops and readings only recover towards the later stages of the transit. 

In our opinion causation is a CA  issue possibly exacerbated by pre-shipment condition of maturity.     

In our opinion this would account for the brown discolouration on the peel as the cells have been starved of oxygen and started to die."

IPIC-7026,"CA shipment. 1 of 4 containers under the bill of lading no other reported issues. Data logger readings activated on the 22nd May and return air of 17.20 C reflects some pre-cooling had already taken place .Gaseous readings also reflect CA  system activated. 

From our analysis of the data logger carriage temperature not an issue. 

Oxygen throughout the transit remained between 12 to 14%, that we believe was due to leakage of the container. Consequently, in view of the length of transit 51 days, respiration remained higher than under CA, leading to premature ripening during the course of transit.  

Shippers temperature recording instrument records nothing untoward concerning temperature."

MWCU5336729, logger readings start on the 14th June at 0700, return air of 18.24°C reflects some pre-cooling had already taken place. Readings up until the 6th July are below 15°C. Return readings then start to climb, and on the 11th July there is a 7 hour period off power. When power is resumed return air has risen to 16.58°C, and remains so until the 18th July when it drops below 16°C and remains so for the duration of the transit. 

Shippers Temptale BNS3107040- 0 activated on the 14th June and records a customary pull down and the trace settling at 16°C or thereabouts up until the 5th July when it starts to increase - plateaus at 20°C before starting to drop. A similar trace to the data logger readings.    

MWMU6417147. Readings activated on the 13th June at 00.00hrs and again return temperatures of 18.50 °C reflect some pre-cooling had already taken place. Up until the 15th July return readings are below 15°C. At 2000hrs readings stop until 0300hrs on the 16th a lapse of 7 hours. Therefter return air readings climb above 15°C and from the 17th are above 16°C. 

Shippers Temptale no BFT3109TPO records a similar pattern with a rise from the 15th July, the spikes relate to periods off power of varying duration but not of significant length.   

It is unusual to have 2 containers with identical problems and both a total loss. 

In our opinion carriage temperature is not the main issue. The transit time was 37 days, plus say 2 days for cutting and packing a total of 39 days. If the fruit was only packed in polybag then this would give a shelf life of 18 to 24 days. If the packing is banavac then 39 days should still provide green life. 

The temperature profiles for both containers reflect the cargo was starting to give of respiration heat indicative that the ripening phase which is irreversible had been entered. 

Therefore, with the information to hand we consider the cause is most likely advanced maturity at the time of packing and or incorrect packing, periods off power may have exacerbated the situation but we do not believe this is the causa proxima.

Therefore , we would recommend in the first instance the claim is rejected."

Data logger was activated 30th June at  1200hrs, return within 2°C of set point after 89 hours. On the 4th at 0800h supply drops to 10.8°C, which is more than the 2° off set deviation allowed for QUEST. Return air throughout the voyage remains above set point.  

Event log records setting changed to 0°C at 11.57 until 12.11 when reverted back to 13.3°C it is unlikely such a short deviation would have caused an issue. Multiple entries for QUEST on/off are displayed together with alarms and we believe this is the reason for the low temperature.

Furthermore, it was found that the container was subject to several extended power off periods:
30/6 @ 19.19 hrs until 01/7 @ 08.13 hrs = 12 hrs 54 min
01/7 @ 19.08 hrs until 02/7 @ 01.03 hrs = 5 hrs 55 min

Neither carriage temperature or C02 readings are an issue. Oxygen levels though never reach setting of 4%, and range between a lowest of 8% and an average of approximately 10%. 

Therefore, we would agree with the surveyors comments that the issue could be the age of the fruit and the storage conditions held under combined with a high oxygen levels that would have increased the respiration rate of the fruit leading to premature ripening.

IPIC-7380,"Based on the condition of the onions at the time of arrival, it is our opinion that there are 2 factors, that in our opinion contributed to the damage and we have allocated a percentage to each, which is to be considered as a guide.

1. The onions were hot stuffed by shipper, with a bulb temperature around 25-30 °C which is close to ambient temperature in Spain during the summer. As the consignment is red onions, they should have been pre-cooled by shipper to within range of requested set point of 4°C, before being presented to carrier. We believe this should be weighted with 50% of the damage and subsequent claim.

2. Reefer unit malfunctioned and was not able to supply air at the requested temperature. According to MERC+, both suction and discharge transducers were replaced and the system was charged with 5 kg of refrigerant, which would account for the lack of cooling capacity. Reefer unit was repaired after gate in to MSC terminal in Valencia and before loading to the vessel, after completion of the repair, the unit pulled down the temperature to within range of set point, where it remained until final delivery. We believe this should equally be weighted with 50%

During our analysis of the data logger, we noticed that when the unit was powered up on 5/7 @ 00.31 hrs , the initial set point was -20°C, which was changed to 4°C on 5/7 @ 16.32 hrs.
This would have been a contributing factor as well, however according to the dates noted on the Ryan recorders, the onions were not stuffed until the 6/7, thus the onions were not subject to freezing and consequently it has no merit."

However, as some of the crates have obvious signs of impact/damage, it cannot be ruled out that some of the damages have occurred during transit, but without EIR's, damage notifications or unit condition report prior to loading, it is very difficult to identify the circumstances for each individual damage."

IPIC-7532,"MWCU6900601 was subject to EPTI and visual inspection prior to export, however reefer unit malfunctioned, most likely caused by a leak in the system resulting in low level of refrigerant and subsequent lack of cooling capacity. Consequently, the reefer unit was not able to maintain the temperature within range of set point, hence causing cargo damage.
Further to the malfunction, reefer unit was subject to frequent and extensive power off periods

During the stay at Mar Del Plata the temperature increased to about -8°C to -10°C, which would have caused the humidity inside the container to rise. An increase in humidity will support and increase the risk of ice formation.
For the remainder of the voyage, reefer unit is attempting to pull temperature back down to set point, however the return air temperature remains 2-5°C above the supply, which would indicate issues with air flow."

We believe stuffing of the container took place on the 14th July, with return readings indicative that some cooling had already taken place. 

Up until the 13th August both supply and return are within acceptable limits. At 05.36 with power on the unit supply remains at correct setting whereas return readings for 13 hours drop to below 0°C. When normal readings resume return is at 14.44°C immediately.  Therefore, we believe this error maybe a faulty sensor rather than actual low temperatures. Towards the later part of the transit return air to increase possibly reflective that the fruit had started to ripen and release heat.

Apart from a faulty return air sensor for the period in question neither the event/alarm log record anything untoward with supply or return air.

Shippers temptale DCR9102Y60  records activation of the 29th July, quick pull down with trace slowly dropping throughout the transit period until the 22nd/23rd August where the trace rises to 20°C before dropping to set point.

The quick in succession periods off power on the 22nd/23rd most likely lead to a rise in temperature of the fruit/respiration leading to the fruit being triggered. It may also have been exacerbated by the condition of the fruit either advanced maturity or disease with issues manifesting during the course of transit combined with the transit time."

It is not recommended to mix different chilled commodities in the same reefer container, as they quite often have different requirements.

This particular container is said to have carried Tomato, Chilli pepper, Red pepper, Green pepper, Cucumber and Watermelons, which all have slightly different temperature requirements.
Tomatoes have 1-3 weeks expected shelf life at 8-10 °C, Chilli pepper is 2-3 weeks expected shelf life at 5-10 °C, Red/Green pepper is 2-3 weeks at 7-10 °C, Cucumber is 2 weeks at 10-12 °C and finally Watermelon is 2-3 weeks at 10-15 °C.
Looking at the various requirements, it would be expected that reefer was updated with a set point of +10 °C rather than +2 °C as per BL in this case.

Furthermore, we noticed from the transit details in the report, that transit time was 45 days, which more or less is the double amount of time compared to the expected shelf life of the before mentioned commodities.

Our analysis of the data logger show that reefer unit was operating normally, without any indication of malfunction and the temperature was maintained within range of requested set point of +2 °C.

We believe that cargo damage may have been caused by the low set point of 2°C, which then has been exacerbated by the transit time, hence we recommend that claim is refuted due to the wrong set point requested by shipper."

One of the photographs taken by consignee of the stowage, show a typical block stowage but is also shows that the top of the stowage is leaning towards the doors, when compared to the bottom of the stowage. This could have a significant impact on the air flow inside the container, as less air flow equals less cooling capacity."

Data logger readings stop on the 1st August with gate out for delivery on the 31st August. It is conjecture on our part but most likely the unit was off power within the port, and we would recommend a physical down load is made of the unit.

There seem to be two issues with this consignment.
1. The onions were hot stuffed, with a temperature around +37°C, compared to the requested carriage temperature of +1°C. This
indicates that the onions were stored under ambient conditions, rather than in a cold store.
2. Initially the reefer unit managed to pull down the temperature of the load to around +8°C, before the reefer unit malfunctioned 5
days into the voyage and was no longer able to maintain the temperature within range of set point,
It is our opinion that the high storage temperature prior being stuffed into the container, would have caused damage to the onions,

IPIC-7914,"Reefer unit malfunctioned between 11/9 and 13/9, and according to MERC+ the unit was repaired in ESALR by repair shop A47.
Reefer unit was displaying alarm 15, which is loss of cooling. The condenser coil and discharge valve replaced, as well as 5 kg refrigerant added to the system, which is consistent with loss of cooling capacity and higher temperatures. After repairs were completed, the reefer unit was running normally and temperature was maintained for the remainder of voyage.

The expected shelf life for this consignment of melons is 3-4 weeks, hence on arrival at final destination the fruit was running out of shelf life. This may have be exacerbated by 36 hrs of high temperature (outside range of set point) during the period of malfunction."

We have not been able to identify who (shipper, haulier or terminal) is responsible for the main part of the power off period.
We  did observe further power off periods during the voyage, but they are within the ML SOP and not considered extensive enough to be the root cause of damage.

Furthermore, when we analyse the data logger, it becomes evident that for the majority of the voyage there is a difference of 3-5°C between supply and return and that return is constantly 2-6°C from set point, which is unusual as this cargo is inert and it would be expected to reach set point.

IPIC-8064,"Although no photos showing the container damage have been presented in this report, it is quite evident that the vast amount of ice build-up thru out the container, must have been caused by water ingress. Furthermore, when looking into MERC+ we found a subsequent work order for structural repairs in connection with doors and door header, which support the findings in surveyors report.
Based on the weather data, supplied by surveyor, we agree that container most likely was damaged during stay in Kolkata. This container should never have been shipped in this condition, firstly to protect the cargo and avoid cargo damage, secondly the container should have been inspected thoroughly as the structural damages are heavy and being fully loaded with cargo, this will increase the risk of structural failure during handling."

IPIC-8066,
IPIC-8067,"We agree with surveyors conclusion that the root cause of damage is due to lack of cooling.

Prior to voyage, reefer unit was subject to EPTI and visual inspection.
Unit is showing multiple ""high pressure switch"" alarms during voyage, which indicates that unit might be running low on refrigerant. This is supported by 2 live reefer repair work orders updated in MERC+, which both include adding refrigerant as well as other repairs.

During voyage there are several off power periods, with the most significant being:
1. 1-4 August whilst at BRRIG, 4-5 hrs every evening and on 4-5/8 more than 7.5 hrs (day of loading to Maersk Lota)
2. On 22/8 whilst on board Maersk Lota, from 08.58 hrs until 23/8 @ 14.14 hrs, in total 29 hrs 16 min.
3. 25-26/8 whilst loading to MSC Kingston in ESALR from 20.21 hrs to 03.57 hrs, in total 7 hrs 36 min.

Whether the malfunction and the power off periods are related or if any of the vessels send a ""malref"" report to EMR vessel support is unknown. 
It is to be expected that any vessel, would attempt to repair malfunctioning reefers whilst on board in order to save the cargo, but available information only show 2 live reefer repairs whilst located in ESVCI.
No live reefer repair was apparently attempted whilst container was in ESALR, although unit was displaying alarms during the entire stay.

Based on above, we recommend that the terminal in BRRIG is held liable due to repeated and extensive off power periods. Maersk Lota is held liable due to off power period of more than 29 hrs and for not attempting to repair the unit. Finally the terminal in ESALR for not attempting to rectify the problems whilst container was located in the terminal.
It will be up to the individual parties, to demonstrate that they followed SOP in a timely manner, attempting to save the cargo."

In our opinion, the ice in the T-floor and on top of the air guide originate from the defrosting cargo, otherwise there would most likely not be any ice on top of the air guide, but in the T-floor only.
This is further supported by lumps of ice attached to the bulkhead, where the defrosting cartons have touched the bulkhead."

Other factors to consider vents closed. Was this at the request of the shipper? Mercantilia publication refers to a setting of 15cbm. We would have expected some ventilation due to the high respiration of the product and the absence of MA  bags. 

We do not believe carriage temperature is the issue. Transit time of 36 days may also be a factor.

Temperature and CO2  are not an issue throughout the voyage. 

Oxygen on the other hand remains high throughout the transit period and as a result the fruit was never under CA  conditions . Consequently the respiration level remained high and combined with a transit time of 48 days the fruit ripened during the course of transit further supported by pulp temperatures of 22.6 to 27.3°C recorded at the time of delivery."

If we have assumed the correct dates we can see nothing wrong with the functioning of the reefer unit.

Was the loss a result of impact damage or blocking of air flow by consignors or a combination of both. 

We have written to the surveyor concerned over the lack of detail in the report.  Claimants should be called upon to reveal the Paksense details. 

As to MWCU5247935  the photographs show cartons above the load line both horizontal and vertical. This would have the affect of blocking the airflow. Data logger not available in RCM.  

With the information to hand and bearing in mind 2 containers from the same shipper with almost identical problems ( excluding roof damage)  we believe the cause is stowage and the claims in the first instance should be rejected."

However, as documented by surveyor, shippers stowage was inadequate to the extent that it more or less completely blocked the airflow at the door end.
This would cause the air flow to short circuit and not provide sufficient cooling for the cargo at the door end, which would slowly start to defrost. With the defrosting of cargo, the humidity levels would increase significantly inside the container, resulting in heavy ice build-up and even less air flow and subsequent less cooling capacity."

This is extremely dangerous and could cause serious injury or in worst case even be fatal. The stowage chosen by shipper is completely inadequate and unacceptable, hence the shipper should be held liable for all costs involved.

Furthermore, it has been noted that the stowage after cross stuffing is also inadequate and unacceptable. Nothing has been done to ensure, that the weight of the coils is distributed correctly in order to lower the point load to within container specification, which could result in another incident, putting lives at risk. Also no proper bracing and lashing has been applied, and this could allow the coils to move during transport which could result in another incident causing injury to people and damage the vessel and container.

Container gated in at the loading port terminal on the 13th July, logger readings activated on the 28th June and return air reflects consignment had been frozen. Set temperature -22°C. The question is whether this was the actual date of stuffing? 

No readings are displayed on the 29th from 1000 to 1100 a period of 25 hours, 30th, 2000 until 1st July 0600, 10 hours,  from the 1st July until the 9th, 8 days. 

On the 9th July at 1200hrs, set temperature changed from -22 to -18°C. Was this the time of loading?. Return temperatures are -16.50°C.  There are no readings between 2000hrs until 0600hrs the following day a period of 10 hours, repeated on the 10th, 11th for 16 hours,12th/13th, 10 hours,  13th/14th, 7 hours,  14th/15th, 6 hours,  15th 15 hours, 15th/16th 6 hours, 16th/17th 16 hours,  17th 6 hours, 20th 9 hours. 

From the 2nd August the unit is working hard to maintain temperature with low supply readings, as the transit continues supply air drops further to -30°C on the 19th August, again indicative of the unit working hard to maintain temperature.  

From our analysis of the data logger we are satisfied the unit functioned correctly. No alarms are recorded in either the alarm or event log. 

The issues to be considered actual date of stuffing, the number of periods off power and stowage of the last two pallets as these do appear to be exceeding the end of the T- bar floor leading to a partial blockage of air. Unfortunately the surveyor was limited to a door end inspection only preventing temperatures taken from further into the load. 

In our opinion the cause is most likely attributable to one or more of the following:

1. Periods off power leading to thawing of the consignment and subsequent displacement of cartons. 
2. Poor air flow at the door end leading to partial defrosting of back two pallets and possibly other pallets located further into the container. 
3. Unit functioned correctly as can be seen to be working hard to maintain temperature."

readings. 

In our opinion cause of ripeness is a combination off power, and high oxygen levels as a result respiration rate of the fruit remained high leading to premature ripening during the course of the 39 day transit.

Surveyor reports nothing untoward was found to the fruit at the time of survey. Only following ripening were all cartons found to be soft green and destroyed.

Correct carriage temperature is maintained throughout the transit as is also the case with CO2  readings.  Oxygen on the other hand is constantly high at 12/13% rather than a setting of 3%. Cause we believe is due to leakage of the unit.

As a result the respiration rate of the fruit remained high leading to premature ripening during the course of the 39 day transit.

In our opinion as oxygen and CO2 readings are either at setting or dropping - power had been applied to the unit earlier than the readings recorded on the data logger. .

Initial return temperature reflects cargo had been pre-cooled. Carriage temperature not an issue. Oxygen and C02 setting record nothing untoward. 

The blemishes on the skins of the avocados are consistent with anthracnose with the fruit affected by circular brown/black spots, that after time will enlarge and become slightly sunken. Infection normally starts in the field and can remain quiescent until after picking and the ripening process has commenced. 

Therefore, with the information to hand we consider the cause is of a pre-shipment nature manifesting during the course of transit."
IPIC-28319,"Container gated in on the 1st October, logger readings commencing that day at 00.36 hrs. Set point 6.1°C and remains so until the 3rd when it is changed to 5.60°C. Initial return readings reflect the consignment had been pre-cooled. From our analysis of the temperature records we do not believe carriage temperature is an issue. 

Shippers Tempsen instruments no FF02GH4055, records nothing untoward with an average reading of 5.5°C. Instrument FF02GH4056, which we believe was placed closer to the door end records an average 8.8°C, most likely due to air flow and return air picking up latent heat from the fruit that may have started to ripen.   

C0 2 readings are within  1% of 5% setting on the 2nd October. Oxygen is much slower but reduces every 24 hours with less than 7% achieved on the 8th, and for the remainder of the voyage fluctuates between 6/ 7%. Event and alarm log record nothing untoward. In our opinion unit functioned correctly. 

Surveyor has attributed the cause to grower issue related. Unfortunately what they have not done is record the pressure of the fruit and we have written to them in this regard.

With the information currently to hand we would concur with their findings, on pre/post harvest issues manifesting during the course of transit."

IPIC-28325,"Surveyor reports that the condition of the garlic recorded nothing untoward and was hot stuffed. Despite this, consignees rejected the load and destroyed such. On the basis of the information provided we consider this to be an unreasonable course of action.   

According to the shippers Temptale DDV1100DFO the unit was activated on the 25th September at 12.57am. Readings are in fahrenheit converted into centigrade with initial readings 10°C. Pull down is relatively slow indicative of latent heat in the produce. Trace is then fairly static throughout the transit period at -0.6°C. 

Data logger readings start on the 26th September at 00.00, with return sensor recording 11.6°C, in line with the shippers data. Over the ensuing days return air gradually drops and takes until the 27th September at 1400hrs, for return air to be within 2°C of set point. Event log records high speed fans, cool max .   Up until the 1st October return readings are below -1°C, from 1800 hrs until 3rd October, return readings then go above -1°C, and from 0500 hrs drop below again until 1700hrs, when they increase again. From the 5th readings are above 0°C and remain so until the 10th when they drop below -1°C, readings then fluctuate above/below -1°C for the duration of the transit. 

We have reviewed the event log and can offer no explanation for this fluctuation currently.  

Our recommendation in the first instance would be to reject the claim on the basis of hot stuffing, shippers temptale records nothing untoward and surveyors remarks that the garlic was in a sound condition. In the event consignes do not accept this we will need to take a further review of the data logger."

""According to the information received from MAERSK FRANCE, the stowage position of container was respectively 11 02 02, 17 04 10 and 49 00 10. -------
On the other hand, flooding in position 11 02 02 is technically possible, with suspicion that flooding may have taken place on AUTUMN E 1616 between Douala and Port Tanger.

On the other hand, it is noted that fresh water damage was noted at time of survey, with negative silver nitrate test, what is not very  consistent with flooding at sea. 

We would agree with the latter remarks and we do wonder whether the wetting is in fact attributable to condensation with water dripping down the side walls onto the floor.

It seems that the cargo temperature was around -15°C at the time of loading, which is slightly out of range from set point, however we do not believe that this is root cause for the ""snow"" effect.

We agree with surveyor that the ""snow"" effect was caused by ambient and humid air entering the container, whilst the unit was running. There are various ways that ambient air could have entered the container:

1. If the stuffing was completed over several sessions, allowing ambient air into the container every time the doors are opened. However, we found no evidence in the temperature log that this would have been the case.

2. If the door gaskets were defective and not keeping the container airtight when the doors are closed. However no gasket repairs mentioned in MERC+

3. If the doors are not closed properly, either due to shipper not closing them correctly or the doors being damaged and/or out of alignment. 

It is our opinion, that based on the facts in this report,  the doors were not closed properly due to misalignment. This is supported by a work order updated in MERC+ which is quoting the replacement of 2 cam keepers. Defective or damaged cam keepers would cause the doors not to close correctly, subsequently allowing ambient air entering the container."

""The ingots had been loaded widthwise and without any element to prevent the movement of the cargo for this reason the ingots shifted concentrated the weight in the middle of the container.
With all of that above in mind, the conclusion must be that heavy cargo, combined with insufficient weight distribution over the entire floor area and insufficient securing of the ingots, had led to the catastrophic collapse of the container MRKU7572803""

IPIC-28438,"Cause of complaint ripes rendering the consignment a possible total loss. 

Surveyor attributes the cause to 

Temperatures at the time of stuffing were higher than required. 
We suspect that some fruit was already starting to mature or even mature when stuffed. This would then have caused other bananas to start ripening during transit. 
Transit time was overly long. 
The fruit had apparently been packed on 11th September and was not stuffed until 21st September. 
Discharge from the vessel in final destination was on 10th November, almost two months after the bananas had been packed.
The ventilation was found closed at the time of inspection. This would have contributed to maintaining the high temperatures in the container caused by the fruit in the process of ripening. We understand that the ventilation should have been open as the bananas were transiting without a controlled atmosphere.
- The boxes used appear not to have been very extensively ventilated. This may have also had an effect on the fruit as the cooled air could not circulate correctly through the cargo.
- The stow was slightly above the maximum load line. This could also have impeded correct cooled air circulation.

In our opinion bananas are not normally pre-cooled so this is not a factor, also ventilation through the carton is quite normal. 

Banavac packing does provide a extended product shelf life and 49 days although it is very much towards the end of the green life the fruit should still have retained some residual value. 

From our analysis of the data logger there is an issue with supply and return air with various alarm codes recorded and this fact together with the vents closed rather than set at 15/20 or 40 cbm is in our opinion the cause."

Container gated in on the 28th September. Logger readings commence that day at 00.51 hrs, return air of 18.20°C reflects some pre-cooling had already taken place. CA system had also been activated. 

Over the ensuing days return gradually drops towards set point of 14°C with under 15°C achieved on the 11th October. From the 4th November readings go above 15°C and this upward trend continues for the duration of the transit with over 16°C reached. This uplift corresponds with a 10 hour period off power.     

Whilst CO2  is close to set point for most of the transit, this is not the case for oxygen that remains high in the most part and particularly towards the latter part of the transit. 

Shippers had placed a temperature recording instrument within the load no FF02GH4613, recording an activation date of the 27th September, graph records an initial pull down to 15°C with the trace remaining steady until the 2nd November when it shows a distinct rise peking on the 10th at 19.4°C.

A view further supported by the data logger recording vents closed rather than a setting of 10cbm as seen by the surveyor. RCM log does not record the vent setting neither does the event log list any events other than defrost. 

Slightly confusing is consignees photograph of vent setting at approximately 10cbm although it is difficult to be precise on this. The other factor is the surveyors comments and we quote:

"" As the data log shows that the vent setting of the container was already closed from  the 1st August 2013, also when the reefer container carried cargoes with a carrying temperature of 6.5°C (period between 28 Sept 2015 and 16 Oct 2015) and 13.8°C (period between 3 March 2016 and 27 May 2016), we wish to receive information as to which cargoes were involved during these two periods  and what was the ventilation instructions for these cargoes"". 

It is not clear whether the vents have always been closed from August 2013, which would be surprising and we have queried this with the surveyor concerned and requested the data logger for recovery purposes against the depot concerned for releasing the container."

At 20.14hrs on the 14th, return readings shoot up to readings in excess of 30°C, with one reading at 69.80°C! From the 15th return readings drop but still remain high at 19/20°C.  

Over the following days oxygen and CO2 start to rise and from the 18th oxygen is at 17%. Supply air is also now an issue with low readings. From the supply is back under some control until the 22nd/23rd when readings are low again. Only on the 1st November are supply/return back to within acceptable parameters.    

Neither the event or alarm log give any reason for the issues described above. 

However, in our opinion the cause of ripes is due to a reefer malfunction during the course of transit leading to elevated temperatures and loss of CA atmosphere resulting in premature ripening of the fruit."

Over the ensuing days return air drops below set point which should not be the case. On the 14th November return rises above set point and remains so for the duration of the transit. There is a 9 hour period off power on the 19th, but we do not believe this is the issue. 

Temperature and C02  readings record nothing untoward leading to ripes. Oxygen on the other hand is never at set point and remains high throughout the transit. 

In our opinion the fruit was never under CA  control due to the high oxygen levels 15 .17%, and as a consequence the respiration of the fruit remained high and combined with the transit time lead to ripes developing during the course of transit."
IPIC-28600,"Surveyor mentions that reefer unit was off  power for 24 hrs on 18/10 and 27/10, and it is correct that no temperature has been logged on those two days, however when comparing the return air temperature from just before the logging stops with the temperature after the logging continues, we believe that unit would not have been off power for the full 24 hour period.  In order to verify events on the two days mentioned, we would require the actual data logger to be forwarded for further analysis.
Unit was off power from 14/11 @ 17.45 hrs until 15/11 @ 01.24 hrs = 7 hrs 39 min.

We are not aware of the scheduled transit time from Mexico to Italy. However, with fruit packed in a banavac bag we would have expected green life to have been maintained. Therefore, we are not convinced delay is the sole issue and the shipper should be called upon to demonstrate when the fruit was cut and that the forward maturity was not a result of pre-shipment issues and or disease manifesting during the course of transit."

Furthermore, from the temperature log we can see that the fruit was not presented to carrier at requested set point, but significantly above. It suggests that the fruit has been stored at ambient temperature, between harvest and stuffing, which we believe is the more likely reason why some fruit arrived with slightly more advanced maturity.

Consignee claimed that the fruit was suffocated due to closed ventilation, but as per surveyors comment, the ventilation was found open and no signs of suffocation was observed.
It is our opinion that the arrival condition of the fruit, is not related to the transit"

Requested set point 15°C. Unit from the 27th September to the 9th October, some 12 days was set at -18°C. Surveyors are of the view the wine froze due to low temperature settings combined with a possible stowage issue. 

The freezing point of wine is dependent upon the alcohol content, as a rule of thumb it is between -6.7 to -9.4°C, with the water content freezing first. The consequence of the freezing is pressure on the necks of the bottles that then crack.   

Once the temperature increased the contents spilled causing cartons to loose their integrity collapse and most likely lead to more breakages."

Carriage temperature is not an issue with return readings below 15°C throughout the voyage. This is also supported by the shippers Temptale. DDGBM019PO.

Gas settings CO2 is in accordance with settings of  5% up until the 4th November when levels start to drop. Readings stop on the 21st November and this remains the case up until the point of delivery on the 24th. 

Oxygen readings throughout transit remain high above 16% and we believe this is the main issue. Respiration rate would have remained higher than required, leading to premature ripening release of ethylene and the development of moulds.

Although supply air is within range, the return air temperature fluctuates slightly (-14°C to -18°C), which could indicate an issue with reduced air flow due to stowage and/or ice build-up, but unfortunately container was not available for inspection, as it had been returned to ML.

All containers were hot stuffed, I.E the return air readings were outside range of requested set point, which would indicate that the onions had been stored at a higher temperature. Normally brown onions would have a shelf life of approximately 120 days at 8°C, however we no information as to the age of the onions when loaded into the container, consequently it difficult to say whether the damage is caused by the onions being at the end of their shelf life.
Furthermore, all containers were  powered off on 9/8 around 08.00 hrs, which apparently is 24 hrs before delivery to consignee, however we do not believe this to be the root cause for damage."

IPIC-28700,Cause of complaint softness to kiwi. Despite this consignees were able to sell the fruit without monetary loss.
IPIC-28701,"1 of 41 containers shipped under the bill of lading, no other reported issues. 

Cause of complaint chilling injury. Opponents surveyor advised pulps temperatures at the time of his attendance were 6.3 to 10.5C. Data logger does not record temperatures lower enough to  cause UPD, there is though an issue with the return air from the 27th November with temperatures readings from 23 to 34C. 

Therefore, we consider the most likely cause is a reefer malfunction."
IPIC-28702,"Issue said to be mould on fruit. We would agree with the surveyor carriage temperature not an issue. 

Vents instead of open were closed. The RCM log records a relative humidity of 99%, in other words the air was saturated with moisture. This factor and with no air exchange most likely lead to the development of mould."
IPIC-28703,"We have now received the actual data logger and survey report from NKKK.

In our initial IPIC comments, we mentioned that based on the difference between supply and return air temperature, we suspected that there could be an issue with the air flow in the container, however we were at that time not able to verify this as the ML surveyor did not inspect the container.
Now that we have had the opportunity to read the NKKK surveyors report, which in description and photographic documentation confirm our conclusion in the initial IPIC comments, that there was an issue where the airflow was restricted.
Subsequent to the voyage, a work order has been updated in MERC+ quoting repairs to the air guide.
Due to the air guide (baffle plate) breaking off its hinges and subsequently dropping to the floor, thus would not only hinder the normal air flow pattern, but would also cause the air flow to short circuit, meaning that the full volume of cold air would not reach the door end.
With the reduction of air flow at the door end, combined with the fact that  the door end on a reefer container is where the most heat leakage is, the temperature could rise significantly and cause cargo damage.

As per the actual data logger, we have noticed that on 13-14 November there are some extensive power off periods where the reefer is off power for approximately 35 hrs in a 48 hr time frame.  
This would normally in itself be sufficient to cause damage to temperature sensitive cargo, such as shrimps. However, in this case where the air flow and subsequently the cooling capacity is already significantly reduced, it would not be considered the root cause of the cargo damage, but it is likely to have exacerbated the damage.

The container was prior to export subject to EPTI, cleaning and a visual inspection by shop N66 in INCCU. The purpose of the visual inspection, is to ensure that there are no obvious damages or parts missing, and the air guide should have been noticed and subsequently repaired by the shop prior to export and thereby avoiding any major cargo damage.

We recommend that shop N66 is held fully liable, due to poor PTI/Repair quality and for releasing faulty equipment for export, hence full recovery should be pursued. 
Furthermore, we also recommend that vessel is held liable for the extensive power off periods on the 13-14 November, exacerbating the cargo damage, consequently recovery should be pursued against the vessel owner and/or operator."

IPIC-28707,"1 of 73 containers shipped under the bill of lading. 

Cause of complaint ripes with the consignment considered a total loss. Container gated in on the 17th November and return temperatures of 17.44°C reflect some pre-cooling had already taken place.  On the 27th November return air readings go above 15°C and this upward trend continues over the following days.

Carriage temperature records nothing untoward. 

Oxygen levels fall from the onset of carriage reaching a low of 6.32% on the 25th November 08.24hrs. Set point 3%. Thereafter oxygen steadily increases with CO2  hovering around 5%.

Neither the event log or alarm log record anything untoward. 

Surveyor noting the roundness of the fruit considers the maturity of the bananas may have been advanced at the time of packing and ripened premature during the course of transit.  And indeed that maybe the case, although we would have expected it not to have been isolated to 1 out of 73 containers. 

Our recommendation would be in the first instance the claim is rejected. Dependent upon the response from claimants the matter may then need to be re-considered as the other possibility is the container started to leak and could not maintain the correct oxygen level and consequently respiration increased leading to premature ripening."

IPIC-28767,"Cargo found partly wet, and with surveyor stating this is due to water ingress thru holes caused by W/T.

We do not agree with surveyors in their conclusion with regards to the root cause of wetting.

1. the container is about 4.5 years old and visually in a normal condition, hence it is unlikely that the roof is corroded to the extent that holes are present. The roof panel is made out of 2mm corten steel which is a corrosion retardant steel, then it has been primed with a zinc rich primer to slow down corrosion even further, before it was painted.

2. The rusty water coming from the joint between top rail and roof panel, is more likely to originate from condensation inside the container and due to the sealer has come or insufficient sealer in the first place, the water enters the gap and the surfaces starts to corrode, which turns the water brown (rusty). Furthermore, there was no mentioning of  desiccation bags being placed in the container, which could have prevented the condensation damage.

3. Upon checking MERC+ we have not found any subsequent repairs in this area of the container, which is unlikely if there indeed would have been corrosion hole present."

Humidity however, drops from 100% and from the 1st November until the 17th, it is at 59/60% and then returning to 100%. This may account for the shrivel and softness.

Each of the coils weigh about 10.900 kgs, and as no timber has been used to spread the wight on the floor structure, the actual point load is exceeding the maximum allowable and containers design capacity.
Furthermore, the maximum capacity of the lashing points inside the container is 1.500 kgs, hence it makes no sense to lash a 11 ton coil to these. When transporting coils, the wight must be distributed to ensure that point load is within design capacity, and they must be braced with a proper timber frame, to avoid any cargo shifting

Gate in for export was on the 5th November, with logger readings commencing on the 6th at 1000hrs, with strange supply and return temperature readings, ranging from minus -26.10°C, set point supply -15.52 to 25.22°C, and return -13.54 to 27.57°C. Readings stop on the 7th November at 0700hrs. 

Shippers Temptale4, not numbered was activated on the 6th November, and records a pull down to 14°C with a further drop to 13°C and the trace more or less ranging between 13 to 14°C throughout the transit. Normally the trace would be a single line, in this instance though the trace is merging due to the number of entries. 

Therefore, in the absence of the full data logger reading  we consider the most likely cause of the ship ripes is a reefer malfunction."

Neither temperature recording device reflects high temperature leading to ripes. 

From the photographs provided we note the pallet on the right hand side at the door end is protruding over the end of the T- bar floor and this may have had an affect on the airflow.  


Transit time of 41 days longer than normal for Russia and this maybe a factor combined with a carriage temperature of 13.7C. However, the most likely cause is maturity of the fruit at the time of packing leading to premature ripening during the course of transit. Therefore, we would recommend the claim is refuted."

Total items declared for wet damage: 22 boxes contained 110 items;
Total items inspected: 15 boxes containing 75 items;
Total items found wet damaged: 30 items;
Total items not inspected as boxes were in good external condition: 7 boxes contained 35 items.

Based on our findings, we can confirm the wet damage of about 30 items out of 75 inspected. Our inspection also confirmed that the content of several boxes, which were only slightly affected by wetness, was in good condition. However, due to bulky and heavy boxes, it was not possible for one surveyor to handle all consignment to make it inspected. Therefore, we recommend Damco, to unpack all boxes and inspect it content in order to verify the condition of items, which were not accessible for inspection."

In our opinion from the scenario at the time of inspection reveals that the Securing/Lashing was found inadequate and so the shifting of cargo within the container caused some damages to the cargo as well as to the Container. Also it was observed there was small dent on the roof panel might have caused due to impact of spreader twist lock.

----- Inadequate wooden support to the cars on the 1st tier and not tight secured toward the container.  Further the 1st tier stowed car was secured against the roof panel and no enough space left between the container roof panel and cargo.

""Based on the download of the reefer data, we would conclude that the reefer unit worked properly throughout the voyage.
The reefer unit was started on 18/11/16 at 19:06 hrs, but the recordings started at 00:59 hrs that day. We thus note high supply and return air temperatures of above30°C, easily going down to 21°C respectively 23°C just before starting of the reefer unit. Upon starting of the unit, the supply air temperature immediately dropped to 14°C and the return air temperature to about 15.5°C.
Each time the reefer unit is stopped for loading or discharging, the temperatures immediately increased to about 18°C.
Upon starting, the CO2-content rised rather rapidly to 4%, the oxygen content then still being about 15.5%. The CO2-content remained stable at around 4% and the O2-content eventually reached about 4% on 10/12/16, but as from 09:59 hrs on 11/12/16, the O2-content started rising again, with a CO2-content remaining at about 5%.
As from then on, the return air temperature that remained stable at about 14.7°C to 15.0°C, is observed also slightly rising.
As from 13/12/16, the CO2-content appears not controllable any longer and it is clear that fresh air was supplied into the unit in order to reduce the CO2-level.
Although the reefer unit appears to have been working properly, the above observations clearly indicate that the bananas had commenced ripening at a certain moment due to what the unit had to anticipate on the rising temperature and definitely on the production of CO2 by the bananas. The unit initially managed to control the temperature and atmosphere inside the container, but near the end of the voyage it could no longer maintain the preset values.
As to the possible time the fruits started ripening, we may comment that the container was gated out for stuffing on 16/11/16 and gated in again on 18/11/16. The reefer unit was actually started on 18/11/16 at 19:06 hrs.
As from the packing codes, it seems though that the bananas had been harvested and / or packed on 14/11/16 between 08:00 and 11:00 hrs, that is 4 days before starting of the reefer unit.
It is not clear to us how the bananas have been stored between time of harvesting and time of starting of the reefer unit, however based on the temperature data on the reefer download, it seems to us that the cargo was definitely not cooled down to 13.3°C as should be for regular storage.
Based on all the above, it thus seems to us that the relevant consignment of bananas had not been stored and cooled properly between time of harvesting and time of stuffing in the relevant container, due to what the fruits had already started ripening prior to shipment.
Once the bananas have started ripening, even a good working reefer unit may not stop this proces and the cargo consequently arrived at Antwerp in fully ripe condition""."

The surveyor has stated sensor malfunction and or low temperature as the root cause, however as stated above, we have not found any indication in the data logger of any issues with any of the sensors. Furthermore, the extreme low temperature (-55.55°C) is related to a software glitch and occurs often when unit is switched on after a power off period, and seems to be very specific for carrier units. The reefer machinery has not been designed in such a way that it actually is capable delivering air at -55.55°C - it is simply physical impossible.

Supply and return readings throughout the transit period record nothing untoward. 

What we have noticed is the software error code where -55°C is recorded this is not reflective of temperature. However, it is far more frequent with this unit than the norm when normally it is is no more than 2 entries per voyage. 

Shippers temperature recording instrument DG61C02ZAO reflects nothing untoward during the course of transit with readings never below set point.
