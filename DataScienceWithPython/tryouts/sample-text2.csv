IPIC-29141,"Cause of complaint ripes. Oxygen level remained high throughout the transit period and this would have meant the respiration rate of the fruit was higher than envisaged leading to premature ripening during the course of transit.Of course the situation may have been exacerbated by pre-shipment quality issues."
IPIC-29142,
IPIC-29143,"Impact damage at terminal in Cotonou, as a result cross stuffing required which was apparently done in a rush, and therefore the surveyor did not record damages other than to 4 bags. Onward shipment to China."
