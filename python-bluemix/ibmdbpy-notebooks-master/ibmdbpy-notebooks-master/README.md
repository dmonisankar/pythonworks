# ibmdbpy-notebooks

Demos, advanced analytics in dashDB using ibmdbPy and IPython Notebooks.

Ibmdbpy is an open-source project developed at IBM. Ibmdbpy provides a Python interface for data manipulation and in-database algorithms in IBM dashDB/DB2 and accelerates Python Analytics by seamlessly pushing operations written in Python into the underlying database for execution to benefit from in-database performance-enhancing features such as columnar store and parallel processing.

These IPython notebooks provide useful examples that you can use as a tutorial to get started with ibmdbPy. You can visualize the rendered IPython notebooks [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ibmdbanalytics/ibmdbpy-notebooks/) or download the repository and execute `ipython notebook` from your terminal.

The ibmdbPy source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ibmdbanalytics/ibmdbpy) and [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ibmdbpy). 

Please visit the [ibmdbPy documentation](http://pythonhosted.org/ibmdbpy/) for more information.
